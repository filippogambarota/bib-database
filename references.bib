  hypothesis holds that efficient facial expression recognition cannot be

  necessarily follow from extant empirical evidence. Next, we report

  that individuals can achieve normotypical efficient facial expression
  recognition despite a congenital absence of relevant facial motor

  working memory (VWM) typically use simple visual features; however, in
  ecological scenarios, VWM typically contains complex objects. Given their
  significance in everyday functioning and their visual complexity, here we
  investigated how upright and inverted faces are forgotten within a few
  seconds, focusing on the raw errors that accompany such forgetting and
  examining their characteristics. In three experiments we found that longer
  retention intervals increased the size of errors. This effect was mainly
  accounted for by a larger proportion of random errors - suggesting that
  forgetting of faces reflects decreased accessibility of the memory
  representations over time. On the other hand, longer retention intervals did
  not modulate the precision of recall - suggesting that forgetting does not
  affect the precision of accessible memory representation. Thus, when upright
  and inverted faces are forgotten there is a complete failure to access them or
  a complete collapse of their memory representation. In contrast to the effect
  of retention interval (i.e., forgetting), face inversion led to larger errors
  that were mainly associated with decreased precision of recall. This effect
  was not modulated by the duration of the retention interval, and was observed
  even when memory was not required in the task. Therefore, upright faces are
  remembered more precisely compared to inverted ones due to perceptual, rather

  two approaches: (a) they focused on the pre-perceptual visual cues, how
  salient facial features or configurations were displayed; or (b) they focused
  on the post-perceptual affective experiences, how emotions affected behavior.
  In this study, we attempted to group emotions at a peri-perceptual processing
  level: it is well known that humans perceive different facial expressions
  differently, therefore, can we classify facial expressions into distinct
  categories in terms of their perceptual similarities? Here, using a novel
  non-lexical paradigm, we assessed the perceptual dissimilarities between 20
  facial expressions using reaction times. Multidimensional-scaling analysis
  revealed that facial expressions were organized predominantly along the
  upper-lower face axis. Cluster analysis of behavioral data delineated three
  superordinate categories, and eye-tracking measurements validated these
  clustering results. Interestingly, these superordinate categories can be
  conceptualized according to how facial displays interact with acoustic
  communications: One group comprises expressions that have salient mouth
  features. They likely link to species-specific vocalization, for example,
  crying, laughing. The second group comprises visual displays with diagnosing
  features in both the mouth and the eye regions. They are not directly
  articulable but can be expressed prosodically, for example, sad, angry.
  Expressions in the third group are also whole-face expressions but are
  completely independent of vocalization, and likely being blends of two or more
  elementary expressions. We propose a theoretical framework to interpret the
  tripartite division in which distinct expression subsets are interpreted as

  the importance for VSTM capacity of more qualitative differences in processing
  for different categories has not been investigated. For example, faces are
  processed more holistically than other objects. In Experiments 1 and 2, we
  show that the processing of faces, objects that are crucial socially and for
  which we possess considerable expertise, overcomes these limitations. More
  faces can be stored in VSTM than objects from other complex nonface
  categories. As in prior studies, at short encoding durations we found that
  capacity for faces was less than that for other categories. However, at longer
  encoding durations, capacity for faces exceeded that for nonface objects, and
  this advantage was specific to upright faces. Because inversion reduces

  least two memory stores: a short, fragile, high-capacity store known as iconic

  memory (VWM). This paper argues that iconic memory stores icons, i.e.,
  image-like perceptual representations. The iconicity of iconic memory has
  significant consequences for understanding consciousness, nonconceptual
  content, and the perception–cognition border. Steven Gross and Jonathan
  Flombaum have recently challenged the division between iconic memory and VWM
  by arguing against the idea of capacity limits in favor of a flexible
  resource-based model of short-term memory. I argue that, while VWM capacity is
  probably governed by flexible resources rather than a sharp limit, the two
  memory stores should still be distinguished by their representational formats.

  used to try to understand the nature of alexithymia: one characterizes the
  condition as an analogue of associative visual object agnosia, and the other
  characterizes it as the emotional equivalent of blindsight. I argue that the
  analogy with blindsight more adequately portrays the processing deficit
  involved in mild alexithymia, but that neither the analogy with blindsight nor
  the analogy with associative visual object agnosia is able to account for the
  deficit involved in severe alexithymia. Instead, I argue that the deficit

  location of the face with a key press as soon as it became visible. The
  modulation of suppression time by emotional expression was taken as an index
  of unconscious emotion processing.Results We found a significant difference in
  the emotional modulation of suppression time between MDD patients and
  controls. This difference was due to relatively shorter suppression of sad
  faces and, to a lesser degree, to longer suppression of happy faces in MDD.
  Suppression time modulation by sad expression correlated with change in
  self-reported severity of depression after 4 weeks.Conclusions Our finding of
  preferential access to awareness for mood-congruent stimuli supports the
  notion that depressive perception may be related to altered sensory
  information processing even at automatic processing stages. Such perceptual
  biases towards mood-congruent information may reinforce depressed mood and
  contribute to negative cognitive biases. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

  differences were found with younger adults showing a general emotionality
  effect (happy and angry faces were more dominant than neutral faces) and older

  by slower rivalry rates for both happy and angry compared to neutral
  face/house pairs in younger adults, and slower rivalry rates for happy
  compared to both angry and neutral face/house pairs in older adults.
  Importantly, these patterns of emotional dominance and slower rivalry rates

  the retina travel to the amygdala via separate cortical and subcortical
  pathways, with the subcortical pathway underlying unconscious processing. Here
  we exploited the phenomenon of binocular rivalry to induce complete
  suppression of affective face stimuli presented to one eye. Twelve
  participants viewed brief, rivalrous visual displays in which a fearful,
  happy, or neutral face was presented to one eye while a house was presented
  simultaneously to the other. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
  study activation in the amygdala and extrastriate visual areas for consciously
  perceived versus suppressed face and house stimuli. Activation within the
  fusiform and parahippocampal gyri increased significantly for perceived versus
  suppressed faces and houses, respectively. Amygdala activation increased
  bilaterally in response to fearful versus neutral faces, regardless of whether
  the face was perceived consciously or suppressed because of binocular rivalry.
  Amygdala activity also increased significantly for happy versus neutral faces,
  but only when the face was suppressed. This activation pattern suggests that
  the amygdala has a limited capacity to differentiate between specific facial
  expressions when it must rely on information received via a subcortical route.
  We suggest that this limited capacity reflects a tradeoff between specificity
  and speed of processing.},

  We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple

  the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to

  settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons

  implications for individuals with impaired social functioning, such as autism
  spectrum disorders (ASDs). Past research has demonstrated that ASDs are
  impaired in the recognition of briefly presented emotions and display atypical
  mimicry of emotions presented for protracted duration. Mimicry
  (electromyography; EMG) of briefly presented emotions was investigated in
  adults with ASDs. Concurrent measures of skin conductance and cardiac
  responses were used as markers of orientation and stimulus detection,
  respectively. A backward masking task was employed whereby the emotional face
  (happy, angry) was presented for 30. ms followed by a neutral face "mask". An
  implicit comparison task required rapid gender identification. The ASD group
  failed to differentiate by valence in their EMG (zygomaticus, corrugator) and
  demonstrated atypical pre- and post-stimulus arousal. These findings may
  provide a potential mechanism for marked deficits in social reciprocity. ©

  in certain face responsive areas located in both the fusiform gyrus and in the

  participants to encode one face or two faces displayed on one side of the

  an index of visual working memory maintenance. Visual working memory
  performance was quantified using indexes of memory capacity (Cowan's K and

  Relative to neutral faces, superior memory and longer change-detection RTs to
  fearful face identities were observed when two faces were displayed on the

  incorporate new information into existing representations over time. Both of
  these processes have been implicated in a type of visual masking called
  object-substitution masking (OSM). Previous studies have found that the number
  of distractors (impacting selective attention) interacts with the strength of
  OSM. However, it has been suggested that this interaction is an artifact of
  ceiling performance at low set sizes, rather than necessitating a failure of
  attention during masking. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we examined
  whether set size and masking interact as measured by markers of selective
  attention (N2pc) and visual working memory consolidation/maintenance (SPCN).
  Set size was found to affect the N2pc (200–350 ms) and late SPCN (500–650 ms),
  reflecting increased demands on selective attention and unnecessary storage
  respectively. An early window of the SPCN (350–500 ms) was affected by
  masking, suggesting that OSM influences object consolidation processes in this
  window, independent of the number of distractors. Overall, it was found that
  selective attention and visual awareness are dissociable neural processes in
  OSM, and that they are independently affected by set size and masking
  manipulations. Moreover, we found that the early SPCN may reflect disruptions

  combined effect of VWM and visual salience was additive; that is, items that

  abstract = {Introduction: Electrodermal activity (EDA) is an early
  physiological index and the subject of constant interest, in spite of the bad
  reputation attached to "lie detectors". This interest is expected to increase
  in the future, following the development of research related to the
  neurobiological aspect of emotions of which it is an index. Recent data
  provided by functional cerebral imaging has added to the significance of this
  index and should result in further interest. Aim: The authors thus re-examined
  the various notions related to measuring EDA, and its practical aspect as well
  as its mechanisms. EDA should be useful both for authors wishing to use this
  variable and for readers wishing to form their own critical point of view.
  Literature findings: The article first defines the various terms used to
  qualify EDA. Then, it analyses the mechanisms occurring at the sweat glands'
  level, showing that a distinct innervation of the sweat glands causes sweat to
  be released in the excretory channels, thereby allowing the recording of a
  negative surface potential in parallel to the lowering of skin conductance.
  Arguments are then pointed out to illustrate that the potential's positive
  phase following this first answer occurs in the case of high intensity
  stimulations. The study of the central command of sudation demonstrates that,
  several areas are involved and that different functions such as thermal
  regulation and motricity may interfere with emotive reactions. Difficulties
  regarding the mode of measurement of these answers as to their number and
  amplitude are also brought to light. Discussion: A particular interest of
  measuring EDA is its ability to highlight individual characteristic and
  unconscious emotional reactivity. Subjects who constitutionally present many
  spontaneous and therefore habitual EDA can indeed be opposed to subjects whose
  EDA reflexes are very few and hardly habitual. A theory suggests that for the
  first category, whose subjects are named labiles, emotional control may be at
  the origin of EDA. This characteristic brings to mind the case of antisocial
  subjects whose rate of EDA is also reduced, although for the latter a
  primitive drop in behavioral inhibition is involved. The production of EDA in
  response to non-conscious emotive stimulations can be objectified in the rare
  cases of prosopagnosia. These subjects who are unable to recognize familiar
  faces can produce EDA when presented faces with an emotional load. These cases
  contrast with the delusional denial of the Capgras syndrome where subjects do
  not present EDA, suggesting that the dysfunction of visual analysis occurs at
  a different level. There are other rare cases represented by cortical
  blindness where EDA shows that an unconscious emotional analysis is preserved.
  These subjects are known however to be capable of unconscious visual
  discriminations, which are possibly accompanied by EDA. This possibility of a
  "blind vision" is experimentally studied via subliminal vision testing
  (backward masking tests). These demonstrate that a rudimentary visual analysis
  is carried out in the subcortical circuits while taking into account the
  affective aspect of stimulations. Conclusion: Present or future data should
  allow a greater comprehension of electrodermal signals, making it possible to
  overcome the difficulties related to their interpretation and facilitate their
  applications. © 2011 L'Encéphale, Paris.},

  abstract = {Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) is characterized by impairments in
  social communication and the avoidance of social contact. Facial expression
  processing is the basis of social communication. However, few studies have
  investigated how individuals with IGD process facial expressions, and whether
  they have deficits in emotional facial processing remains unclear. The aim of
  the present study was to explore these two issues by investigating the time
  course of emotional facial processing in individuals with IGD. A backward
  masking task was used to investigate the differences between individuals with
  IGD and normal controls (NC) in the processing of subliminally presented
  facial expressions (sad, happy, and neutral) with event-related potentials
  (ERPs). The behavioral results showed that individuals with IGD are slower
  than NC in response to both sad and neutral expressions in the sad-neutral
  context. The ERP results showed that individuals with IGD exhibit decreased
  amplitudes in ERP component N170 (an index of early face processing) in
  response to neutral expressions compared to happy expressions in the
  happy-neutral expressions context, which might be due to their expectancies
  for positive emotional content. The NC, on the other hand, exhibited
  comparable N170 amplitudes in response to both happy and neutral expressions
  in the happy-neutral expressions context, as well as sad and neutral
  expressions in the sad-neutral expressions context. Both individuals with IGD
  and NC showed comparable ERP amplitudes during the processing of sad
  expressions and neutral expressions. The present study revealed that
  individuals with IGD have different unconscious neutral facial processing
  patterns compared with normal individuals and suggested that individuals with
  IGD may expect more positive emotion in the happy-neutral expressions context.
  Highlights: • The present study investigated whether the unconscious
  processing of facial expressions is influenced by excessive online gaming. A
  validated backward masking paradigm was used to investigate whether
  individuals with Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and normal controls (NC)
  exhibit different patterns in facial expression processing. • The results
  demonstrated that individuals with IGD respond differently to facial
  expressions compared with NC on a preattentive level. Behaviorally,
  individuals with IGD are slower than NC in response to both sad and neutral
  expressions in the sad-neutral context. The ERP results further showed (1)
  decreased amplitudes in the N170 component (an index of early face processing)
  in individuals with IGD when they process neutral expressions compared with
  happy expressions in the happy-neutral expressions context, whereas the NC
  exhibited comparable N170 amplitudes in response to these two expressions; (2)
  both the IGD and NC group demonstrated similar N170 amplitudes in response to
  sad and neutral faces in the sad-neutral expressions context. • The decreased
  amplitudes of N170 to neutral faces than happy faces in individuals with IGD
  might due to their less expectancies for neutral content in the happy-neutral
  expressions context, while individuals with IGD may have no different
  expectancies for neutral and sad faces in the sad-neutral expressions context.

  evidence (shorter stimulus exposure times) to become aware of the face
  targets. This anxiety-based difference was observed for fearful faces in all
  experiments, but with non-threat faces, it emerged only when these were

  information. Materials and methods: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over
  design was used with 15 healthy female participants. Subjective mood was
  recorded at baseline and after 4 h, when participants performed an explicit
  emotional face processing task, and a task eliciting unconscious processing of
  emotionally aversive and neutral images presented subliminally using backward
  masking. Results: ATD was associated with a robust reduction in plasma
  tryptophan at 4 h but had no effect on mood or autonomic physiology. ATD was
  associated with significantly lower attractiveness ratings for happy faces and
  attenuation of intensity/arousal ratings of angry faces. ATD also reduced
  overall reaction times on the unconscious perception task, but there was no
  interaction with emotional content of masked stimuli. ATD did not affect
  breakthrough perception (accuracy in identification) of masked images.
  Conclusions: ATD attenuates the attractiveness of positive faces and the
  negative intensity of threatening faces, suggesting that serotonin contributes
  specifically to the appraisal of the social salience of both positive and
  negative salient social emotional cues. We found no evidence that serotonin
  affects unconscious processing of negative emotional stimuli. These novel

  unseen. For the first time, we isolate the unconsciously perceived features of
  a stimulus by using "Bubbles" (Gosselin \& Schyns, 2001), a technique that
  reveals the information in an image that is useful ('diagnostic') for a given
  task. Faces (n = 10) are presented in an unconscious repetition priming
  paradigm similar to that of Dehaene et al. (2001). The presentation sequence
  mask-blank-prime-blank-mask-target leads to conscious repetition priming. The
  inversion of the blanks and the masks abolishes the awareness of the prime but
  not the priming effect, thus generating unconscious repetition priming. In
  both conditions, the primes are presented under "bubble masks". These masks
  only allow a proportion of the prime to be seen in the two-dimensional image
  plane and also selectively reveal information on the third dimension of
  spatial scale. Observers (n = 5) are asked to indicate by pressing the
  appropriate key, as precisely and as rapidly as possible, the gender of the
  target over 2000 trials. Then, a regression is run on the bubble masks and the
  response times and statistical analyses are conducted on the difference
  between the two conditions' regression coefficients. Preliminary results
  indicate a complex pattern of differences. Isolating the features of the
  visual scene that are unconsciously perceived is a crucial step towards
  identifying the neural substrates of unconscious perception.},

  stimuli. Zajonc proposed that the MEE occurs because repeated unconscious
  presentation of a stimulus automatically elicits approach toward it, and thus,
  positive affect. We present the first test of Zajonc's hypothesis of what we
  term an approach mere exposure effect.We did so by using an implicit measure
  that identifies preferred stimuli by assessing automatic approach reactions. A
  total of 42 highly socially anxious and 39 nonanxious control participants
  were administered masked exposures to either angry or neutral faces. Then they
  reacted to visible pictures of angry or neutral faces that were either
  previously presented (old) or new in one of two ways. They either (a) pulled a
  joystick toward themselves, which created the visual effect of approaching
  these stimuli (stimulus preference), or (b) pushed a joystick away from
  themselves, which created the effect of avoiding the stimuli. Mere exposure to
  angry faces caused socially anxious participants to pull-approach-old angry
  faces more quickly than new angry faces, that is, an approach MEE. Nonanxious
  participants nearly approached old neutral faces more quickly than new neutral
  faces. Mere exposure to angry faces also caused socially anxious participants
  to approach visible angry faces generally, and counterintuitively, to approach
  angry faces faster than they avoided them, whether they were old or new. These
  results suggest that the approach MEE generalized to have fear-reducing
  effects in socially anxious persons. © 2019 American Psychological

  decreases even more the information that is available about which stimulus was
  shown because the variance of the spike counts is increased. When the onset of
  the mask follows the onset of the test stimulus by 20 ms, each neuron fires
  for approximately 30 ms, provides on average 0.06 bits of information, and
  human observers perform at approximately 50\% better than chance in forced
  choice psychophysics, yet say that they are guessing, and frequently report
  that they are unable to consciously see the face and identify which face it
  is. At a longer Stimulus Onset Asynchrony of 40 ms, the neurons fire for
  approximately 50 ms, the amount of information carried by a single neuron is
  0.14 bits, and human observers are much more likely to report conscious

  neuronal firing and information that is present when stimuli can be
  discriminated but not reported on consciously, and the additional amount of
  neuronal firing and information that is required for humans observers to
  consciously identify the faces. It is suggested that the threshold for

  small but significant information is present in neuronal firing, so that the

  the level of consciousness, where subcortical regions of the brain are thought
  to play an important role. In the absence of conscious visual experience,
  patients with visual cortex damage discriminate the valence of emotional
  expression. Even in healthy individuals, a subliminal mechanism can be
  utilized to compensate for a functional decline in visual cognition of various
  causes such as strong sleepiness. In this study, sleep deprivation was
  simulated in healthy individuals to investigate functional alterations in the
  subliminal processing of emotional information caused by reduced conscious
  visual cognition and attention due to an increase in subjective sleepiness.
  Fourteen healthy adult men participated in a within-subject crossover study
  consisting of a 5-day session of sleep debt (SD, 4-h sleep) and a 5-day
  session of sleep control (SC, 8-h sleep). On the last day of each session,
  participants performed an emotional face-viewing task that included backward
  masking of nonconscious presentations during magnetic resonance scanning.
  Results: Finally, data from eleven participants who were unaware of
  nonconscious face presentations were analyzed. In fear contrasts, subjective
  sleepiness was significantly positively correlated with activity in the
  amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and insular cortex, and
  was significantly negatively correlated with the secondary and tertiary visual
  areas and the fusiform face area. In fear-neutral contrasts, subjective
  sleepiness was significantly positively correlated with activity of the
  bilateral amygdala. Further, changes in subjective sleepiness (the difference
  between the SC and SD sessions) were correlated with both changes in amygdala
  activity and functional connectivity between the amygdala and superior
  colliculus in response to subliminal fearful faces.Conclusion: Sleepiness
  induced functional decline in the brain areas involved in conscious visual
  cognition of facial expressions, but also enhanced subliminal emotional
  processing via superior colliculus as represented by activity in the amygdala.
  These findings suggest that an evolutionally old and auxiliary subliminal

  abstract = {Background: Alexithymia and emotional awareness may be considered
  overlapping constructs and both have been shown to be related to psychological
  and emotional well-being. However, it is not clear how the constructs relate
  to each other empirically or if they may overlap more or less in different
  populations. The aim of this review was therefore to conduct a meta-analysis
  of correlations between the most commonly used measures of alexithymia (i.e.,
  the self-report instrument Toronto Alexithymia Scale; TAS-20) and emotional
  awareness (i.e., the observer-rated instrument Level of Emotional Awareness
  Scale; LEAS) and to explore potential moderators of their relationship.
  Methods: Electronic databases were searched for studies published until the
  end of February 2018. Study samples were coded as medical conditions,
  psychiatric disorders and/or healthy controls and sample mean age and gender
  distribution were extracted. Correlations between the TAS-20 and the LEAS were
  subjected to a random effect of meta-analysis and moderators were explored in
  subgroup analyses and meta-regressions. Publication bias was considered.
  Results: 21 studies reporting on 28 independent samples on correlation
  analysis were included, encompassing a total of 2857 subjects (57\% women).
  The aggregated correlation between TAS-20 and LEAS was r = -0.122 (95\% CI
  [-0.180, -0.064]; Z = -4.092; p < 0.001), indicating a significant, but weak,
  negative relationship between the measures. Heterogeneity was moderate, but we
  found no indication of significant differences between patients with medical
  conditions, psychiatric disorders or healthy controls, nor that mean age or
  percentage of female subjects moderated the relationship. The overall estimate
  became somewhat weaker after adjusting for possible publication bias.
  Conclusions: Our results indicate that TAS-20 and LEAS measure different
  aspects of emotional functioning. The small overlap suggests that alexithymia
  and emotional awareness are distinct constructs of emotional well-being.
  Clinicians need to assess both aspects when considering treatment options for
  individual patients. Moreover, from the clinical standpoint, an easy reliable
  and valid way of measuring emotional awareness is still needed. More research
  should be focus on the differences between alexithymia and emotional awareness
  in specific conditions, but also how to integrate self-report instrument and
  observed based measures in a clinical situation. © 2018 Maroti, Lilliengren

  in the context of encounters with animals and threatening humans. It is argued
  that animal fear originates in a predatory defense system whose function is to
  allow animals to avoid and escape predators. Animal stimuli are postulated to
  be differentially prepared to become learned elicitors of fear within this
  system. Social fears are viewed as originating in a dominance/submissiveness
  sytem. The function of submissiveness is to avert attacks from dominating
  conspecifics. Signs of dominance paired with aversive outcomes provide for
  learning fear to specific individuals. Data which in general are interpreted
  as supportive of this conceptualization are reviewed. To explain the mechanism
  behind the causal relationships suggested in the evolutionary analysis, an
  information-processing model is presented and empirically tested. It is argued
  that responses to evolutionary fear-relevant stimuli can elicit the
  physiological concomitants of fear after only a very quick, 'unconsciousness,'
  or preattentive stimulus analysis. Support for this notion is presented from
  backward masking studies where it is demonstrated that conditioned autonomic

  common mechanism with different features consuming different amounts of
  bandwidth, Experiment 3 presented a colour patch and an oriented grating

  simultaneous than the sequential condition, with orientation showing a larger
  impairment than colour. These results suggest that consolidation of both
  features share common mechanisms. However, it seems that colour requires less

  consolidated in parallel without exceeding the bandwidth limit, whereas two
  orientations or an orientation and a colour exceed the bandwidth and appear to
  be consolidated serially. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

  STM was assessed in two-force choice tests, using a delayed match to sample
  paradigm. In experiment 3, the n-back memory test with different interstimulus
  intervals (up to 14 sec) was used. It was found that subjects after medication
  with the saffron extract demonstrated better correct memorizing of the

  medication somewhat improved retention of visual STM, but only for several

  mnemonic representations in high-level frontoparietal regions are modulated by
  attentional priority, such as temporal order. To test this hypothesis, we
  examined whether the most recent item, which has a higher attentional priority
  in terms of temporal order, is preferentially encoded in frontoparietal
  regions. On each trial, participants viewed 2 gratings with different
  orientations in succession, and were cued to remember one of them. Using fMRI
  and an inverted encoding model, we reconstructed population-level, orientation
  representations in occipital (V1-V3), parietal (IPS), and frontal (FEF) areas
  during memory maintenance. Unlike early visual cortex where robust orientation
  representations were observed regardless of serial order, parietal, and
  frontal cortices showed stronger representations when participants remembered
  the second grating. A subsequent experiment using a change detection task on
  color rings excluded the possibilities of residual stimulus-driven signals or
  motor preparative signals for responses. These results suggest that mnemonic
  representations in parietal and frontal cortices are modulated by
  temporal-order-based attentional priority signals. © The Author(s) 2018.

  working memory (VWM) that match target features increase the speed with which
  the target reaches visual awareness. To examine the effect of VWM on
  perception, previous studies have mainly used coarse measures of awareness,
  such as present/absent or forced-choice judgments. These methods can reveal
  whether or not an individual has seen an item, but they do not provide
  information about the quality with which the item was seen. Using continuous
  report methods it has been shown that the fidelity of a perceived item can be
  affected by whether or not that item is masked. In the present study, we used
  an object-substitution masking task to examine whether items held in VWM would
  influence the quality with which a masked target reached awareness, or whether
  the threshold for awareness was instead affected by stimuli held in memory. We
  observed that targets matching the contents of VWM were recalled with greater
  precision compared to items that did not match the contents of VWM.

  patterns that discriminated the remembered feature were found in regions of

  neurons in the ventral temporal lobe. In contrast, attentional selection and

  colliculi to thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate. The author

  the probability of occurrence of the upcoming stimulus. This " frequency
  effect" is generally attributed to a form of conscious expectancy. Contrary to
  this belief, we show that frequency effects can be completely accounted for by
  an unconscious memory-based mechanism. Subjects discriminated the cut-off side
  of an odd-color diamond in a three-element display. We changed the ratio of
  red- to green-target stimuli from 20\% to 100\%. Across all conditions the
  run-lengths of red- and green-target stimuli were kept constant at 3 by
  interleaving irrelevant blue-yellow stimulus combinations with relevant
  red-green trials (the clustering manipulation). We observed a large frequency
  effect with a single irrelevant stimulus: e.g., responses to red targets
  became faster when red appeared 100\% than when it appeared 20\% of the time
  relative to green. The effect became smaller with 3 irrelevant stimuli and was
  completely abolished by inserting 7 irrelevant stimuli. It was previously
  shown that in this task each trial leaves an implicit memory trace for the
  target defining feature that lasts ∼ 8-10 trials, and that individual traces
  sum. In the absence of clustering, frequency effects are due to the fact that
  more frequent stimuli have longer run lengths, thus more memory is allowed to
  accumulate because of repetition of the same target feature, leading to
  response facilitation. The clustering manipulation enabled us to control the
  amount of memory that accumulates, consequently modulating the frequency
  effect. A single irrelevant stimulus allowed most memory accumulation and thus
  a large frequency effect. With seven irrelevant stimuli there was no
  accumulation and responses to the target appearing 100\% and 20\% of the time
  did not differ. These results demonstrate that implicit working memory, with
  its inherent unconscious coding of frequency distributions, can completely
  explain probability effects in visual search.},

  abstract = {Visual working memory provides an essential link between
  perception and higher cognitive functions, allowing for the active maintenance
  of information about stimuli no longer in view. Research suggests that
  sustained activity in higher-order prefrontal, parietal, inferotemporal and
  lateral occipital areas supports visual maintenance, and may account for the
  limited capacity of working memory to hold up to 3-4 items. Because
  higher-order areas lack the visual selectivity of early sensory areas, it has
  remained unclear how observers can remember specific visual features, such as
  the precise orientation of a grating, with minimal decay in performance over
  delays of many seconds. One proposal is that sensory areas serve to maintain
  fine-tuned feature information, but early visual areas show little to no
  sustained activity over prolonged delays. Here we show that orientations held
  in working memory can be decoded from activity patterns in the human visual
  cortex, even when overall levels of activity are low. Using functional
  magnetic resonance imaging and pattern classification methods, we found that
  activity patterns in visual areas V1-V4 could predict which of two oriented
  gratings was held in memory with mean accuracy levels upwards of 80\%, even in
  participants whose activity fell to baseline levels after a prolonged delay.
  These orientation-selective activity patterns were sustained throughout the
  delay period, evident in individual visual areas, and similar to the responses
  evoked by unattended, task-irrelevant gratings. Our results demonstrate that
  early visual areas can retain specific information about visual features held
  in working memory, over periods of many seconds when no physical stimulus is
  present. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

  with drastic increase in subjective visibility. This retroperception effect
  demonstrates that postcued attention can retrospectively trigger the conscious
  perception of a stimulus that would otherwise have escaped consciousness. It
  was known that poststimulus events could either suppress consciousness, as in
  masking, or alter conscious content, as in the flash-lag illusion. Our results

  leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Traditional risk factors
  predict 75-80\% of an individual's risk of incident CVD. However, the role of
  early life experiences in future disease risk is gaining attention. The Barker
  hypothesis proposes fetal origins of adult disease, with consistent evidence
  demonstrating the deleterious consequences of birth weight outside the normal
  range. In this study, we investigate the role of birth weight in CVD risk
  prediction. Methods and Results—The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) represents
  a large national cohort of post-menopausal women with 63 815 participants
  included in this analysis. Univariable proportional hazards regression
  analyses evaluated the association of 4 self-reported birth weight categories
  against 3 CVD outcome definitions, which included indicators of coronary heart
  disease, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, carotid artery disease
  and peripheral arterial disease. The role of birth weight was also evaluated
  for prediction of CVD events in the presence of traditional risk factors using
  3 existing CVD risk prediction equations: one body mass index (BMI)-based and
  two laboratory-based models. Low birth weight (LBW) (< 6 lbs.) was
  significantly associated with all CVD outcome definitions in univariable
  analyses (HR=1.086, p=0.009). LBW was a significant covariate in the BMI-based
  model (HR=1.128, p<0.0001) but not in the lipid-based models. Conclusion—LBW
  (<6 lbs.) is independently associated with CVD outcomes in the WHI cohort.

  abstract = {Access to WM can be restricted on the basis of goal-relevant
  properties such as spatial location. However, the extent of voluntary control
  over which features of an attended multi-feature object are encoded and
  maintained in WM is debated. Some evidence suggests that attending to an
  object leads to obligatory storage of all of its features, whereas other
  evidence suggests that access to WM can be restricted to only goal-relevant
  features. Another possibility is that all features are initially encoded, but
  irrelevant features are removed from WM over time. To address these various
  possibilities, we used pattern classification of EEG signals to track the
  temporal evolution of representations reflecting the encoding and storage of
  task-relevant and irrelevant features in WM. In different blocks, participants
  remembered the orientation, color or both orientation and color of a colored,
  oriented grating. The color and orientation of the grating was randomly drawn
  from two distinct feature bins on each trial. To examine trial-specific
  activity reflecting storage of the object's features, a support vector machine
  (SVM) classifier was trained to classify what bin the stimulus features came
  from. Importantly, for orientation, the classifier produced reliably
  above-chance classification across the delay when orientation was
  task-relevant but not when it was task-irrelevant. Interestingly, orientation
  could be accurately classified on trials for which both orientation and color
  were remembered. Moreover, a separate measure corresponding to the probability
  of a feature belonging to the correct bin was significantly higher when
  orientation was task-relevant compared to task-irrelevant during encoding.
  Above-chance classification for color was only present during the initial 500
  msec across all conditions. Our results suggest that although information

  reliable MVPA decoding of the identity of a stimulus representation that was
  kept in working memory or internally generated, despite the fact that the
  overall BOLD response was low or even at baseline levels. Here we ask how it
  is possible that reliable stimulus information can be decoded from early
  visual cortex even when the overall BOLD signal remains low. We reanalyzed a
  data set in which human participants (N = 24) imagined or kept in working
  memory an oriented visual grating. We divided voxels from V1, V2, and V3 into
  groups based on orientation preference, and compared the time course of mean
  BOLD responses to preferred and non-preferred orientations with the time
  course of the multivariate decoding performance. Decoding accuracy related to
  a numerically small, but reliable univariate difference in the mean BOLD
  response to preferred and non-preferred stimuli. The time course of the
  difference in BOLD responses to preferred and non-preferred orientations was
  highly similar to the time course of the multivariate pattern classification
  accuracy. The reliability of the classification strongly correlated with the
  magnitude of differences in BOLD signal between preferred and non-preferred
  stimuli. These activity differences were small compared to the large overall
  BOLD modulations. This suggests that a substantial part of the task-related
  BOLD response to visual stimulation might not be stimulus-specific. Rather,
  stimulus-evoked BOLD signals in early visual cortex during a task context may
  be an amalgam of small stimulus-specific responses and large task-related but
  non-stimulus-specific responses. The latter are not evident during the
  maintenance or internal generation of stimulus representations, but provide an
  explanation of how reliable stimulus information can be decoded from early
  visual cortex even though its overall BOLD signal remains low.},

  the population coding model for circular variables to the non-circular and

  memory; however, previous studies have mainly been performed on the auditory
  modality but not the visual modality. To clarify the neural mechanism of
  visual TSP, we performed a psychophysical experiment and recorded
  event-related potentials (ERPs) under different T1/T2 combinations. Three
  successive black/white sinusoidal gratings (30 ms duration) were presented to
  the participants. In the psychophysical experiment, either T1 or T2 was varied
  from 240 to 560 ms in 40-ms steps, while T2 or T1 was fixed at 400 ms.
  Participants judged whether T1 and T2 were equal or not by pressing a button.
  ERPs were recorded from 128 scalp electrodes, while T1 was varied from 240,
  320, and 400 ms with the 400 ms T2 duration, and vice versa. Behavioral data
  showed asymmetrical assimilation: When −80 ms ≤ (T1 − T2) ≤ +120 ms, TSP was
  observed in the T1-varied condition. When −120 ms ≤ (T1 − T2) ≤ +80 ms, it was
  also observed in the T2-varied condition. These asymmetric time ranges in

  T1 and T2 were not equal. The neural responses in the fronto-central region

  remain largely unknown. In this study, observers remembered the orientations
  of 4 briefly presented gratings, one in each quadrant of the visual field. A
  10Hz Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) triplet was applied directly at
  stimulus offset, or midway through a 2-second delay, targeting early visual
  cortex corresponding retinotopically to a sample item in the lower hemifield.
  Memory for one of the four gratings was probed at random, and participants
  reported this orientation via method of adjustment. Recall errors were smaller
  when the visual field location targeted by TMS overlapped with that of the
  cued memory item, compared to errors for stimuli probed diagonally to TMS.
  This implied topographic storage of orientation information, and a
  memory-enhancing effect at the targeted location. Furthermore, early pulses
  impaired performance at all four locations, compared to late pulses. Next,
  response errors were fit empirically using a mixture model to characterize
  memory precision and guess rates. Memory was more precise for items proximal
  to the pulse location, irrespective of pulse timing. Guesses were more
  probable with early TMS pulses, regardless of stimulus location. Thus, while
  TMS administered at the offset of the stimulus array might disrupt early-phase
  consolidation in a non-topographic manner, TMS also boosts the precise
  representation of an item at its targeted retinotopic location, possibly by
  increasing attentional resources or by injecting a beneficial amount of noise.

  orientation change discrimination did not depend on either an irrelevant

  internal shifts of attention to memoranda of visual stimuli of different
  brightness maintained in working memory, in the absence of any visual
  stimulation. Across 3 studies, we reveal dilation of the pupil when
  participants orient attention to the memorandum of a dark grating relative to

  is merely incidental and not required for the working-memory task of judging
  stimulus orientation. Furthermore, relative dilation and constriction of the

  1 or the other stimulus would be probed across the retention delay. The
  results provide surprising and consistent evidence that pupil responses are
  under top-down control by cognitive factors, even when there is no direct

  analysis revealed that the orientation of each remembered grating was
  classified more accurately based on activity patterns in the contralateral

  areas exhibited similar levels of performance across the two hemispheres. A
  time-resolved analysis further indicated that the retinotopic specificity of

  maintaining no longer directly accessible information. How robust are visual
  memories against interference? Memory for simple visual features has proven
  vulnerable to distractors containing conflicting information along the
  relevant stimulus dimension, leading to the idea that interacting
  feature-specific channels at an early stage of visual processing support
  memory for simple visual features. Here we showed that memory for a single
  randomly orientated grating was susceptible to interference from a
  to-be-ignored distractor grating presented midway through a 3-s delay period.
  Memory for the initially presented orientation became noisier when it differed
  from the distractor orientation, and response distributions were shifted
  toward the distractor orientation (by 3°). Interestingly, when the distractor
  was rendered task-relevant by making it a second memory target, memory for
  both retained orientations showed reduced reliability as a function of
  increased orientation differences between them. However, the degree to which
  responses to the first grating shifted toward the orientation of the
  task-relevant second grating was much reduced. Finally, using a dichoptic
  display, we demonstrated that these systematic biases caused by a consciously
  perceived distractor disappeared once the distractor was presented outside of
  participants' awareness. Together, our results show that visual short-term
  memory for orientation can be systematically biased by interfering information

  momentarily close our eyes, some details persist while others seem to fade.
  Discrete models of visual working memory (VWM) assume that only a few items
  can be actively maintained in memory, beyond which pure guessing will emerge.
  Alternatively, continuous resource models assume that all items in a visual
  scene can be stored with some precision. Distinguishing between these
  competing models is challenging, however, as resource models that allow for
  stochastically variable precision (across items and trials) can produce error
  distributions that resemble random guessing behavior. Here, we evaluated the
  hypothesis that a major source of variability in VWM performance arises from
  systematic variation in precision across the stimuli themselves; such
  stimulus-specific variability can be incorporated into both discrete-capacity
  and variable-precision resource models. Participants viewed multiple oriented
  gratings, and then reported the orientation of a cued grating from memory.
  When modeling the overall distribution of VWM errors, we found that the
  variable-precision resource model outperformed the discrete model. However,
  VWM errors revealed a pronounced "oblique effect," with larger errors for
  oblique than cardinal orientations. After this source of variability was
  incorporated into both models, we found that the discrete model provided a
  better account of VWM errors. Our results demonstrate that variable precision
  across the stimulus space can lead to an unwarranted advantage for resource
  models that assume stochastically variable precision. When these deterministic
  sources are adequately modeled, human working memory performance reveals
  evidence of a discrete capacity limit. (PsycINFO Database Record},

  proposed that access consciousness, or narrow cognitive accessibility, is

  consciousness, or broad cognitive accessibility, is related to iconic memory
  or, more recently, to a fragile (intermediate) short-term memory store with a
  larger capacity than working memory. They have also highlighted the
  preattentive nature of phenomenal consciousness and of the related iconic and
  fragile visual short-term stores, thus selectively linking attention with
  access consciousness, in line with Baars and Dehaene, among others. However, a
  range of electrophysiological and neurophysiological studies suggest that
  visual attention can affect early responses of neurons in visual cortex,
  before conscious access. Furthermore, some theories and neurocomputational
  models suggest earlier attentional biases related to phenomenal consciousness.
  To solve this controversy, and to shed light on the relationships of attention
  with iconic memory and subsequent stages of visual maintenance, we conducted
  an experiment with a novel procedure of change detection based on delayed
  cueing of the target for report with high- and low-priority objects marked by

  phenomenal consciousness before access consciousness: a first preattentive
  stage related to iconic memory and a second stage related to fragile visual
  short-term memory intermediate between iconic and visual working memory, which
  is modulated by visual attention in a time-dependent manner. Finally, our
  results suggest the dissociation between a mid-level visual attention
  modulating phenomenal consciousness and a central attention directing access

  resolution of electroencephalographic recordings to directly link a cascade of

  (peaking ~200 ms), which reflects stimulus-specific attentional orienting and
  allocation, (2) the sustained posterior-contralateral negativity (post-N2pc),
  which has been associated with sustained visual processing, (3) the
  contralateral reduction in oscillatory alpha power (contralateral reduction in

  decode the set size and net load from the EEG signal. CDA, NSW, and decoding
  accuracy predicted an individual's working memory capacity. In line with the

  suggest that participants tended to encode items relatively balanced. In sum,
  this novel change detection task offers a basis to make use of converging

  water was used as the control treatment before the WM task. Exposure to CPS
  was associated with a significant increase in blood pressure and salivary
  cortisol. After the 3-min resting period, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
  diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for the CPS session significantly increased
  relative to the control treatment session (all p ≤ 0.01), and data also showed
  a significant increase of 20-min post-treatment cortisol concentration (p <
  0.001) for CPS. Data from the CPS session showed significantly longer reaction
  times, lower accuracy, and WM capacity scores than that of the control
  treatment session. Interestingly, a difference between the two sessions was
  also found in N2pc and the late contralateral delay activity (late CDA)
  components. Specifically, although non-significant main effects of treatment
  were found for N2pc amplitudes, there was a significant interaction between
  treatments and stimuli conditions (processing load) [F(2,46) = 3.872, p =
  0.028, η2 p = 0.14], which showed a pronounced trend toward equalization of
  N2pc amplitude across stimuli conditions during the CPS session clearly

  the mean amplitude of the late CDA (−2.56 ± 0.27) for CPS treatment was

  preferred to make use of the positive cues, as indicated by a CDA
  contralateral to the positive color in negative cue blocks, and a lack of

  Widows, 2005) and performed two cognitive tasks in which search displays
  containing a lateralized singleton encircled a fixation point that changed
  luminance from trial-to-trial. When searching for the singleton as a target,
  PPI-R scores were uncorrelated with ERP measures of its salience (Ppc),
  goal-directed selection (N2pc), and working memory evaluation (negative
  amplitude CDA). In contrast, when responding to the changes in luminance at
  fixation and ignoring the lateral singleton as a salient distractor, PPI-R
  Self-Centered Impulsivity factor scores were positively correlated with a
  potential indicator of distractor suppression (a sustained positive amplitude
  CDA). These findings provide support for a neurophysiological interpretation
  of the changes in visual-spatial attention associated with psychopathic
  personality traits: normal selection of target information accompanied by
  greater elimination of distractor information at a later visual working memory
  stage. © 2020, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

  choice between two tasks, people tend to choose tasks requiring less cognitive

  it is still not clear to what extent individual differences in cognitive
  control can account for variations in DA. We sought to elucidate the relation
  between cognitive control and cognitive effort preferences by investigating
  the extent to which sustained neural activity in a task requiring cognitive
  control is correlated with DA. We hypothesized that neural measures of
  efficient filtering will predict individual variations in demand preferences.
  To test this hypothesis, we had participants perform a delayed-match-to-sample
  paradigm with their ERPs recorded, as well as a separate behavioral
  demand-selection task. We focused on the ERP correlates of cognitive filtering
  efficiency (CFE)—the ability to ignore task-irrelevant distractors during
  working memory maintenance—as it manifests in a modulation of the
  contralateral delay activity, an ERP correlate of cognitive control. As
  predicted, we found a significant positive correlation between CFE and DA.
  Individuals with high CFE tended to be significantly more demand avoidant than
  their low-CFE counterparts. Low-CFE individuals, in comparison, did not form

  studies put forth evidence for the presence of a distributed VWM network

  cortex (ACC). Nonetheless, the understanding of the functional role of ACC is
  still debated. We recorded the high-density EEG in 20 healthy participants

  generating distractibility, and exerts a large detrimental effect on aging.
  The present EEG study tested the role of a new stimulus dimension in
  generating distractibility in visual Working Memory (vWM), namely numerical
  similarity. In a change detection paradigm a varying number of relevant and
  irrelevant stimuli were presented simultaneously in opposite hemifields.
  Behavioral results indicated that young participants outperformed older
  individuals; however, in both groups numerical similarity per se did not
  modulate performance. At the electrophysiological level, in young participants
  the Contralateral Delay Activity (CDA, a proxy for item maintenance in vWM)
  was modulated by the numerosity of the relevant items regardless of numerical
  similarity. In older participants, the CDA was modulated by target numerosity
  only in the same numerical condition, where the total number of (relevant and
  irrelevant) items increased with increasing target numerosities. No effect was
  present in the dissimilar numerical condition, where the total number of items
  did not vary substantially across target numerosity. This pattern was
  suggestive of an age-related effect of the total number of (relevant and
  irrelevant) items on vWM. The additional analyses on alpha-band lateralization
  measures support this interpretation by revealing that older adults lacked
  selective deployment of attentional and vWM resources towards the relevant
  hemifield. Overall, the results indicate that, while numerical similarity does
  not modulate distractibility, there is an age-related redistribution of vWM
  resources across the two visual fields, ultimately leading to a general
  decrease in task performance of older adults. © 2019 Tagliabue et al. This is

  age, gender, and education. Spatial cues evoked larger N2pc amplitudes, a
  correlate of spatial attention, in patients than controls (p 0.7). Memory
  distractors evoked larger contralateral delay activity amplitudes, a correlate
  of working memory load, in patients (p =.028; Cohen's d = 1.1)but not controls
  (p =.64). Conclusions: Prior to initiating treatment, hematologic cancer
  patients demonstrated poor control over spatial attention and working memory,
  consistent with altered dorsal attention and central executive network
  activity. Significance: Hematologic cancer patients may be at a higher risk
  for selecting, processing, and storing distracting information that would
  compete with more immediate goal-related behaviors. © 2019 International

  sequence of visual events over short periods of time, for example, when making
  sense of others’ actions or watching a movie. While there is increasing
  knowledge available on neural mechanisms underlying visual working memory
  (VWM) regarding the identity and spatial location of objects, less is known
  about how the brain encodes and retains information on temporal sequences.
  Here, we investigate whether the contralateral-delay activity (CDA), a
  well-studied electroencephalographic (EEG) component associated with VWM of
  object identity, also reflects the encoding and retention of temporal order.
  In two independent experiments, we presented participants with a sequence of
  four or six images, followed by a 1 s retention period. Participants judged
  temporal order by indicating whether a subsequently presented probe image was
  originally displayed during the first or the second half of the sequence. As a
  main novel result, we report the emergence of a contralateral negativity
  already following the presentation of the first item of the sequence, which
  increases over the course of a trial with every presented item, up to a limit
  of four items. We further observed no differences in the CDA during the
  temporal-order task compared to one obtained during a task concerning the
  spatial location of the presented items. Since the characteristics of the CDA
  appear to be highly similar between different encoded feature dimensions and
  increases as additional items are being encoded, we suggest this component
  might be a general characteristic of various types of VWM. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  Thus, it is important to select and maintain information that is relevant

  mechanism of these processes has yet to be identified. One potential candidate
  are alpha oscillations (8–14 Hz), which have been shown to inhibit stimulus

  increases with set size suggesting that alpha oscillations are involved either
  in memory maintenance or in the inhibition of task-irrelevant information to
  protect relevant information from interference. The need for such a protection
  should increase with the amount of distracting information, but most previous
  studies did not show any distractors. Therefore, we directly tested whether
  alpha oscillations are involved in inhibition of distractors during memory

  embedded among irrelevant distractors. Distractors were either strong or weak
  and were present during the retention interval after which participants
  reported the orientation of probed targets. Computational modeling showed that
  performance decreased with increasing set size and stronger distraction. Alpha
  power in the retention interval generally increased with set size, replicating
  previous studies. However, here stronger distractors reduced alpha power. This

  electrophysiological markers of attentional selection (N2pc component) and
  working memory (sustained posterior contralateral negativity; SPCN) in search
  tasks where two possible targets were defined by feature conjunctions (e.g.,
  blue circles and green squares). Critically, some search displays also
  contained nontargets with two target features (incorrect conjunction objects,
  e.g., blue squares). Because featurebased guidance cannot distinguish these
  objects from targets, any selective bias for targets will reflect object-based
  attentional control. In Experiment 1, where search displays always contained
  only one object with target-matching features, targets and incorrect
  conjunction objects elicited identical N2pc and SPCN components, demonstrating
  that attentional guidance was entirely feature-based. In Experiment 2, where
  targets and incorrect conjunction objects could appear in the same display,
  clear evidence for object-based attentional control was found. The target N2pc
  became larger than the N2pc to incorrect conjunction objects from 250 ms
  poststimulus, and only targets elicited SPCN components. This demonstrates
  that after an initial feature-based guidance phase, object-based templates are
  activated when they are required to distinguish target and nontarget objects.
  These templates modulate visual processing and control access to working
  memory, and their activation may coincide with the start of feature
  integration processes. Results also suggest that while multiple feature

  amplitude effects with NA across task conditions. These results indicate a
  reduction in a physiological measure of VWM capacity in high-NA participants.

  controversial whether these capacity limitations are domain-general or are

  These alternative accounts were tested in bi-modal visual/tactile WM tasks. In
  Experiment 1, participants memorized the locations of simultaneously presented
  task-relevant visual and tactile stimuli. Visual and tactile WM load was
  manipulated independently (one, two, or three items per modality), and one
  modality was unpredictably tested after each trial. To track the activation of
  visual and tactile WM representations during the retention interval, the
  visual contralateral delay activity (CDA) and tactile CDA (tCDA) were measured
  over visual and somatosensory cortex, respectively. CDA and tCDA amplitudes
  were selectively affected by WM load in the corresponding (tactile or visual)
  modality. The CDA parametrically increased when visual load increased from one
  to two and to three items. The tCDA was enhanced when tactile load increased
  from one to two items and showed no further enhancement for three tactile
  items. Critically, these load effects were strictly modality-specific, as
  substantiated by Bayesian statistics. Increasing tactile load did not affect
  the visual CDA, and increasing visual load did not modulate the tCDA. Task
  performance at memory test was also unaffected by WM load in the other
  (untested) modality. This was confirmed in a second behavioral experiment
  where tactile and visual loads were either two or four items, unimodal
  baseline conditions were included, and participants performed a color change
  detection task in the visual modality. These results show that WM capacity is
  not limited by a domain-general mechanism that operates across sensory

  the anterior P170, reflecting long-term storage. We additionally tracked
  attentional preparation and deployment in the contingent negative variation

  reduced with four memorized items. At the electrophysiological level, globally
  completed (vs. mosaic) objects gave rise to a corresponding increase in CDA

  relative to unimodal single-task baselines have been attributed to a
  modality-unspecific central WM store, but such costs could also reflect
  increased demands on central executive processes involved in dual-task
  coordination. To compare these hypotheses, we asked participants to maintain
  two, three, or four visual items. Unimodal trials, where only this visual task

  the additional maintenance of two tactile items, were randomly intermixed. We
  measured the visual and tactile contralateral delay activity (CDA/tCDA

  There were reliable dual-task costs, as visual CDA components were reduced in
  size and visual WM accuracy was impaired on bimodal relative to unimodal
  trials. However, these costs did not depend on visual load, which caused
  identical CDA modulations in unimodal and bimodal trials, suggesting that
  memorizing tactile items did not reduce the number of visual items that could
  be maintained. Visual load did not also affect tCDA amplitudes. These findings
  indicate that bimodal dual-task costs do not result from a competition between
  multisensory items for shared storage capacity. Instead, these costs reflect

  abstract = {Selection and preparation of action plans (task sets) is often
  assumed to occur in working memory (WM). Yet, the absence of consistent
  evidence that WM capacity and task selection efficiency is correlated raises
  questions about the functional relationship between these two aspects of
  executive control. We used the EEG-derived contralateral delay activity (CDA)
  to index the WM load of task sets. In Experiment 1, we found a CDA set size
  effect (2 vs. 4 stimulus-response [S-R] rules) for high-WM, but not for
  low-WM, individuals when S-R sets were novel. In contrast, when only four task
  sets were presented throughout the experiment, we observed a sustained yet set
  size-independent use of WM for high-WM participants. More-over, Experiment 2
  showed an increase of the CDA in situations with task conflict, and this
  effect was larger the more that participants experienced RT conflict effects.
  Combined, these results indicate that even highly familiar S-R settings are
  maintained in WM, albeit in a compressed manner, presumably through cues to
  long-term memory representations. Finally, participants with low-WM capacity
  represented even familiar tasks in a load-dependent manner, suggesting that
  the establishment of effective retrieval structures itself is a
  capacity-limited process. © 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

  which could manipulate two levels of WM load (low-load task using 4 items and
  high-load task using 6 items) during the deception process. The analyses based

  indexes visual short term memory abilities, was altered in both groups of
  patients, with a non-linear pattern of amplitude modulation along the
  continuum of the disease: a reduction in AD and an increase in MCI. These
  results indicate that AD pathology shows a progressive decline in MOP, which
  is associated to the decay of visual short-term memory mechanisms. Crucially,
  CDA may be considered as a useful neural signature both to distinguish between
  healthy and pathological aging and to characterize the different stages along
  the AD continuum, possibly becoming a reliable candidate for an early
  diagnostic biomarker of AD pathology. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors. All

  attentional guidance is possible when target colors remain constant and can
  thus be represented in long-term memory but not when they change frequently
  and have to be held in working memory. Participants searched for one, two, or
  three possible target colors that were specified by cue displays at the start
  of each trial. In constant-color blocks, the same colors remained
  task-relevant throughout. In variablecolor blocks, target colors changed
  between trials. The contralateral delay activity (CDA) to cue displays
  increased in amplitude as a function of color memory load in variable-color
  blocks, which indicates that cued target colors were held in working memory.
  In constant-color blocks, the CDA was much smaller, suggesting that color
  representations were primarily stored in long-term memory. N2pc components to
  targets were measured as a marker of attentional target selection. Target
  N2pcs were attenuated and delayed during multiple-color search, demonstrating
  less efficient attentional deployment to colordefined target objects relative
  to single-color search. Importantly, these costs were the same in

  The goal of this study was to utilize ERPs that are elicited by a change
  detection task to examine biases in selective attention (i.e., N2pc) and
  working memory maintenance (i.e., contralateral delay activity; CDA).
  Additionally, the effect of self-focus was examined using false heart rate
  feedback. In support of the manipulation, self-focus cues resulted in greater
  self-reported self-consciousness and task interference, enhanced anterior P2
  amplitude and reduced SPN amplitude. Moreover, P2 amplitude for self-focus
  cues was correlated with reduced task performance for socially anxious
  subjects only. The difference in P2 amplitude between self-focus and standard
  cues was correlated with social anxiety independent of depression. As
  hypothesized, socially anxious participants (n = 20) showed early selection
  and maintenance of disgust faces relative to neutral faces as indicated by the
  N2pc and CDA components. Nonanxious controls (n = 22) did not show these
  biases. During self-focus cues, controls showed marginal evidence of biased
  selection for disgust faces, whereas socially anxious subjects showed no bias
  in this condition. Controls showed an ipsilateral delay activity after being

  simultaneously, but only a few of visual representations can be held in the
  mind to guide subsequent goal-oriented behaviors, which indicates the limited
  capacity of visual working memory. Meanwhile, the neural representations of
  visual stimuli can be noisy and hence the memory precision is varying. This
  review systematically illustrates the roles of neural oscillations in
  maintaining visual working memory and neural mechanisms underlying the
  capacity and precision. In the end, several potential directions of this field
  for future studies are discussed. A large amount of researches demonstrates
  that during the maintenance of visual working memory representations, the
  theta band oscillations can facilitate the neural information communications
  between brain regions throughout a relative long distance, in order to achieve
  the top-down cognitive control; the alpha band oscillations, which was
  initially considered as an electrophysiological correlate of cortical idling,
  are now generally treated to reflect functional inhibition or non-engagement
  of a given brain regions, in order to gate neural information to the
  task-relevant regions; as for gamma band, the high frequency oscillation
  property make it suitable for the integration of multiple object features in
  the local neural network and hold the relevant representations. Therefore,
  theta and gamma band engage in the maintenance of working memory
  representations directly, while alpha oscillations serve in an indirect way of
  functional inhibition. In addition, the cross frequency coupling and neural
  synchronization enable the collaboration of different brain regions in the
  working memory network. The contralateral delay activity (CDA) is widely
  acknowledged to be an online electrophysiological marker of working memory
  capacity. In addition, the alpha oscillations in irrelevant regions also have
  a strong correlation with individual capacity. Early studies that aimed to
  explore memory capacity limit introduce the slot model of working memory,
  which regards working memory as few fixed discrete slots and cannot be divided
  between items. However, more and more experiments that are designed to study
  memory precision come to conceptualize working memory as a limited resource
  that can be shared between different representations, and put forward the
  resource model of working memory. One of the major differences of these two
  models is the change of memory precision with memory load increasing, so the
  study of memory precision is conductive to figure out the working memory
  model. Although several behavioral studies have demonstrated that both
  capacity and precision are two distinct aspects of working memory, some
  electrophysiological researches propose that CDA and alpha band oscillations
  can also represent the memory precision. Therefore, more studies would be
  needed to explore the neural substrates of memory precision. In addition to
  the passive maintenance of working memory representations, the active
  manipulation of memories, such as updating, is a potential direction of
  working memory studies, since it can give us a whole picture of how the memory
  resources are dynamically distributed among objects. Moreover, neural decoding
  of objects is also an important research perspective, which can directly
  manifest the storage of memory representations. © 2016, Science Press. All

  can influence the processing of subsequent information. The present study used
  a spatial cuing paradigm to investigate the origins of this persisting
  influence by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG. An
  irrelevant color cue that was either contingent (color search) or
  non-contingent (shape search) on attentional sets was presented prior to a
  target array with different stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOA; 200, 400, 800
  ms). Behavioral results indicated that color cues captured attention only when
  they shared target-defining properties. These same-location effects persisted
  over time but were pronounced when cue and target array were presented in
  close succession. N2 posterior contralateral (N2pc) showed that the color cue
  generally drew attention, but was strongest in the contingent condition. A
  subsequently emerging contralateral posterior positivity referred to the
  irrelevant cue (i.e., distractor positivity, Pd) was unaffected by the
  attentional set and therefore interpreted as an inhibitory process required to
  enable a re-direction of the attentional focus. Contralateral delay activity
  (CDA) was only observable in the contingent condition, indicating the transfer
  of spatial information into working memory and thus providing an explanation
  for the same-location effect for longer SOAs. Inhibition of this irrelevant
  information was reflected by a second contralateral positivity triggered
  through target presentation. The results suggest that distracting information
  is actively maintained when it resembles a sought-after object. However, two
  independent attentional processes are at work to compensate for attentional
  distraction: the timely inhibition of attentional capture and the active
  inhibition of mental representation of irrelevant information. © 2016 Mertes,

  Past evidence suggested that WM holds all features of multidimensional objects
  together, but struggles to integrate color-color conjunctions. This difficulty
  was previously attributed to a challenge in same-dimension integration, but
  here we argue that it arises from the integration of 2 distinct objects. To
  test this, we examined the integration of distinct different-dimension
  features (a colored square and a tilted bar). We monitored the contralateral
  delay activity, an event-related potential component sensitive to the number
  of objects in WM. The results indicated that color and orientation belonging
  to distinct objects in a shared location were not integrated in WM (Experiment
  1), even following a common fate Gestalt cue (Experiment 2). These
  conjunctions were better integrated in a less demanding task (Experiment 3),
  and in the original WM task, but with a less individuating version of the
  original stimuli (Experiment 4). Our results identify the critical factor in
  WM integration at same- versus separate-objects, rather than at same- versus
  different-dimensions. Compared with the perfect integration of an object's
  features, the integration of several objects is demanding, and depends on an
  interaction between the grouping cues and task demands, among other factors. ©

  were presented with visual objects in different colors, and a cue presented in

  activity, an event-related brain potential that reflects working-memory load

  data of two experiments showed that when filter settings had to be adjusted on
  a trial-by-trial basis, more irrelevant information passed the gate to working
  memory. Moreover, this switching-induced filtering deficit was restricted to
  those items that matched the previous, but currently irrelevant, filter
  settings. Thus, lingering effects of the selection history seem to counteract

  of the event-related potential (ERP) marks the attention-based rehearsal of
  tactile information in somatosensory brain regions. We tested whether the tCDA
  reflects the competition for shared attention resources between a WM task and
  a perceptual task under dual-task conditions. The two tasks were always
  performed on opposite hands. In different blocks, the WM task had higher or
  lower priority than the perceptual task.The tCDA's polarity consistently
  reflected the hand where the currently prioritized task was performed. This
  suggests that the process indexed by the tCDA is not specific to the domain of
  WM, but mediated by a domain-unspecific attention mechanism. The analysis of
  transient ERP components evoked by stimuli in the two tasks further supports
  the interpretation that the tCDA marks a goal-directed bias in the allocation
  of selective attention. Larger spatially selective modulations were obtained
  for stimulus material related to the high-, as compared to low-priority, task.
  While our results generally indicate functional overlap between the domains of

  such as stimulus similarity, lead to superior VWM performance. However, the
  neural correlates underlying these benefits to VWM performance remain unclear.
  One neural index, the contralateral delay activity (CDA), is an event-related
  potential that shows increased amplitude according to the number of items held
  in VWM and asymptotes at an individual’s VWM capacity limit. Here, we applied
  the CDA to determine whether previously reported behavioral benefits supplied

  savings such that the CDA amplitude was reduced when these cues were present.
  We implemented VWM change-detection tasks with arrays including similarity and
  proximity (Experiment 1); uniform connectedness (Experiments 2a and 2b); and
  similarity/proximity and uniform connectedness (Experiment 3). The results
  indicated that when there was a behavioral benefit to VWM, this was echoed by
  a reduction in CDA amplitude, which suggests more efficient processing.
  However, not all perceptual grouping cues provided a VWM benefit in the same
  measure (e.g., accuracy) or of the same magnitude. We also found unexpected
  interactions between cues. We observed a mixed bag of effects, suggesting that
  these powerful perceptual grouping benefits are not as predictable in VWM. The

  Experiment 1, we compared the WM maintenance of one whole polygon to a single
  half of the polygon, equating the number of items but varying the complexity
  level. Additionally, we compared the whole polygon to two halves of a polygon,
  thus roughly equating perceptual complexity but manipulating the number of
  items. The results suggested that only the number of objects determined WM
  capacity allocation: the CDA was identical when comparing one whole polygon to
  one polygon half, even though these conditions differed in complexity.
  Furthermore, the CDA amplitude was lower in the whole polygon condition
  relative to the two halves condition, even though both contained roughly the
  same amount of information. Experiment 2 extended these results by showing
  that two polygon halves that moved separately but then met and moved together
  were gradually integrated to consume similar WM capacity as one polygon half.
  Additionally, in both experiments we found an object benefit in accuracy,
  corroborating the important role of objects in WM. Our results demonstrate
  that WM capacity allocation cannot be explained by complexity alone. Instead,
  it is highly sensitive to objecthood, as suggested by discrete slot models. ©

  examined the effects of directing attention toward versus away from the
  targets, no previous research has assessed how attentional allocation varies
  as a function of target-flanker distance in crowding. Here, we used ERPs to
  assess the operation of attention during crowding, focusing on the
  attention-related N2pc component. We used a typical crowding task in which
  participants were asked to report the category (vowel/consonant) of a
  lateralized target letter flanked by distractor letters at different
  distances. We tested the hypothesis that attention fails when the
  target-flanker distance becomes too small for attention to operate
  effectively. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that N2pc amplitude was
  maximal at intermediate target–flanker distances and decreased substantially
  when crowding became severe. In addition, we examined the sustained posterior
  contralateral negativity (SPCN), which reflects the amount of information
  being maintained in working memory. Unlike the N2pc component, the SPCN
  increased in amplitude at small target–flanker distances, suggesting that
  observers stored information about the target and flankers in working memory

  Importantly, we find that the mCDA also receives contribution from current
  sources in the ventral extrastriate cortex that display a time-course similar
  to the parietal sources. On the basis of the magnetic responses, forward
  modeling of ERP data reveals that the ventral sources have non-optimal
  projections and that these sources are therefore concealed in the ERP by
  overlapping fields with parietal projections. The present observations

  advocated by prominent WM models hold that the units of memory are configured
  either as independent feature representations, integrated bound objects, or a
  combination of both. Here, we approached this issue by measuring lateralized
  brain electrical activity during a retro-cue paradigm, in order to track
  people's ability to access WM representations as a function of the dimensional
  relation between WM items and task settings. Both factors were revealed to
  selectively influence WM access: whereas cross relative to intradimensional WM
  targets gave rise to enhanced contralateral delay activity (CDA) amplitudes,
  localization relative to identification task demands yielded speeded CDA and
  manual response times. As these dimension-based findings are not reconcilable

  We assessed changes in behavioral performance and in ERP components associated
  with various stages of processing. After practice, response time decreased in
  all participants (while accuracy remained consistent), and
  electrophysiological measures revealed modulation of several ERP components.
  First, amplitudes of the early sensory-evoked N1 component at 150 ms increased
  bilaterally, indicating enhanced visual sensory processing of the array.
  Second, the negative-polarity posterior–contralateral component (N2pc, 170–250
  ms) was earlier and larger, demonstrating enhanced attentional orienting.
  Third, the amplitude of the sustained posterior contralateral negativity

  whether complexity has an effect on the capacity, and one of the critical

  than simple objects. Thus we investigated the influence of precision
  requirements on the allocation of VWM capacity resources, by comparing VWM
  capacity under different levels of sample-test similarity in a
  change-detection task. If the VWM capacity is limited by a fixed number of
  items, then the capacity should not be affected by precision requirements;
  however, if the capacity is allocated flexibly, then precision requirements
  should influence the capacity. Cowan's K and amplitude of contralateral delay
  activity (CDA) were used as behavioral and neurophysiological measures of VWM
  capacity, respectively. Cowan's K for high-precision discrimination was
  calculated on the basis of the accuracy of a small number of large-change
  trials inserted into high-precision blocks. This approach avoided the
  confounder of different test-phase difficulties between the low- and
  high-precision conditions and controlled for errors during the test phase. The
  results showed no effect of precision requirements on VWM capacity. However,
  analysis of the late positive component (LPC) amplitude indicated that higher

  The tCDA manifests over somatosensory cortex contralateral to task-relevant

  locations was stimulated again at memory test. The two relevant pulses were
  unpredictably located on the same hand (stay trials) or on different hands
  (shift trials). Initially, tCDA components emerged contralateral to the
  relevant S1 pulse. Sequential loading of WM enhanced the tCDA after S2 was
  presented on stay trials. On shift trials, the tCDA’s polarity reversed after
  S2 presentation, resulting in delay activity that was now contralateral to the
  task-relevant S2 pulse. The disappearance of a lateralized neural trace for
  the relevant S1 pulse did not impair memory accuracy for this stimulus on

  proximity and common fate, play a fundamental role in how we perceive and

  object representation as a separate item was updated by a subsequent Gestalt
  grouping cue (i.e., proximity or common fate). We used a version of the color
  change detection paradigm, in which the objects started to move separately,
  then met and stayed stationary, or moved separately, met, and then continued
  to move together. We monitored the object representations on-line using the
  contralateral delay activity (CDA; an ERP component indicative of the number
  of maintained objects), during their movement, and after the objects
  disappeared and became working memory representations. The results
  demonstrated that the objects' representations (as indicated by the CDA
  amplitude) persisted as being separate, even after a Gestalt proximity cue
  (when the objects "met" and remained stationary on the same position). Only a
  strong common fate Gestalt cue (when the objects not just met but also moved
  together) was able to override the objects' initial separate status, creating
  an integrated representation. These results challenge the view that Gestalt
  principles cause reflexive grouping. Instead, the object initial
  representation plays an important role that can override even powerful

  inhibition control in HTA individuals have mainly focused on tasks that
  required the inhibition of prepotent response tendencies. Studies on the
  suppression of emotionally neutral distractors from WM in trait anxiety have
  also been minimal. In this article, we present a study on the manifestation of
  general inefficient filtering of neutral distractors during visual-spatial WM
  maintenance stages in HTA individuals. Female participants performed a
  visual-spatial WM task while event-related potentials were recorded. They were
  made to remember the orientations of red rectangles within half of the screen
  and to ignore all salient green rectangles. As predicted, no significant main
  effect of group and no interaction between group and condition were found in
  the N2pc component, suggesting that group differences did not manifest in the
  initial process of object individuation. During the subsequent WM maintenance
  phase, HTA individuals were highly inefficient at filtering the irrelevant
  items from WM, as reflected not only by parallel late contralateral delay
  activity (CDA; 450 to 900 ms) amplitudes for the distractor condition and the
  four red items, but also by a smaller filtering efficiency score in the HTA
  group than in the low-trait-anxiety group. Extending previous studies, our

  maintenance and retrieval. We measured encoding-stage processing with the P1
  component, maintenance-stage processing with the contralateral delay activity

  new items (old–new effect). Older adults showed lower behavioral capacity
  estimates (K) than did younger adults, but surprisingly, their P1 components

  indicated that the P1 and CDA did not accurately assess their VWM capacity.
  However, the neural activity evoked during VWM retrieval yielded results that
  helped clarify the age-related differences. During retrieval, younger adults
  showed early old–new effects in frontal and occipital areas and a late
  central–parietal old–new effect, whereas older adults showed a late
  right-lateralized parietal old–new effect. The younger adults’ early old–new
  effects strongly resembled an index of perceptual fluency, suggesting that
  perceptual implicit memory was activated. The activation of implicit memory
  could have facilitated the younger adults’ behavior, and the lack of these
  early effects in older adults may suggest that they have much lower-resolution

  This modulation of alpha power and behavioral performance, however, is
  dependent on people's natural VSTM capability such that only the low
  performers benefitted from the stimulation, whereas high performers did not.
  This behavioral dichotomy is accounted by prestimulus alpha powers around the
  parieto-occipital regions: low performers showed decreased prestimulus alpha
  power, suggesting improvement in attention deployment in the current paradigm,
  whereas the high performers did not benefit from tDCS as they showed
  equally-low prestimulus alpha power before and after the stimulation.
  Together, these results suggest that prestimulus alpha power, especially in
  low performers, can be modulated by anodal stimulation and alter subsequent
  VSTM performance/capacity. Thus, measuring alpha before stimulus onset may be
  as important as measuring other VSTM-related electrophysiological components
  such as attentional allocation and memory capacity related components (i.e. N2
  posterior-contralateral, N2pc, or contralateral delay activity, CDA). In

  performance patients displayed several changes in the neuronal markers of the
  memory processes. Their CDA amplitude was smaller; it showed less
  load-dependent modulation and lacked the reduction observed when controls
  performed the same task three months later. The smaller CDA in the patients
  could be attributed to more ipsilateral cortical activity which may indicate
  that ALS patients unnecessarily processed the irrelevant stimuli as well. The
  latter is presumably related to deterioration of the frontal cortex in the
  patient group which was indicated by slight deficits in tests of their
  executive functions that increased over time. The frontal pathology presumably
  affected their top-down control of memory storage in remote regions in the
  posterior brain. In sum, the present results demonstrate functional changes in
  neuronal networks, i.e. neuroplasticity, in ALS that go well beyond the known

  be compensated for by intact low level processes in posterior brain regions. ©

  later in the retention interval, leading to better WM performance. The only
  effect of Diagnosis was a smaller CDA in adolescents and adults with ADHD than

  whereas the all-or-none hypothesis claims that either both enter into VWM
  simultaneously, or neither does. Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested the
  two hypotheses by asking participants to remember two or four complex objects.
  An ERP component, contralateral delay activity (CDA), was used as the neural
  marker. CDA is higher for four objects than for two objects when coarse
  information is primarily extracted; yet, this CDA difference vanishes when
  detailed information is encoded. Experiment 1 manipulated the comparison
  difficulty of the task under a 500-ms exposure time to determine a condition
  in which the detailed information was maintained. No CDA difference was found
  between two and four objects, even in an easy-comparison condition. Thus,
  Experiment 2 manipulated the memory array's exposure time under the
  easy-comparison condition and found a significant CDA difference at 100 ms
  while replicating Experiment 1′s results at 500 ms. In Experiment 3, the
  500-ms memory array was blurred to block the detailed information; this
  manipulation reestablished a significant CDA difference.
  Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that the creation of
  high-resolution representations in VWM is a coarse-to-fine process. © 2013 Gao

  explored this issue by focusing on a critical point on which they make

  presented at three separate locations or three features bound at one location.
  While presenting multiple features- regardless of whether they are at discrete
  locations or bound within a single object-resulted in greater CDA amplitude

  Filtering efficiency in visual WM can be measured via the lateralized change
  detection task with distractors. From an array of items, only a subsample must
  be memorized (targets), whereas distractors must be filtered out. From the EEG
  recorded while items are maintained in memory, slow potentials over posterior

  distractors were filtered out. Efficient filtering mechanisms are also highly
  important in multiple object tracking (MOT). We trained participants'
  filtering ability with the aid of this latter task. Filtering in both tasks is
  assumed to happen via allocation of selective attention. We observed large

  in memory. Results confirmed the involvement of attention in VSTM recall.
  However, the amplitude of the N2pc and N3rs components, which mark orienting
  of attention and search within VSTM, decreased as a function of delay.
  Conversely, the amplitude of the P3 and sustained posterior contralateral
  negativity components increased as a function of delay, effectively the
  opposite of the N2pc and N3rs modulations. These effects were only observed
  when verbal memory was not taxed. Thus, the results suggested that gradual
  recoding from visuospatial orienting of attention into verbal recall
  mechanisms takes place from short to long retention intervals. Interestingly,
  recall at longer delays was faster than at short delays, indicating that

  considerable importance for encoding task-relevant items into visual
  short-term memory (VSTM) according to our behavioral goals. However, it is not
  known whether top-down attentional biases can continue to operate during the
  maintenance period of VSTM. We used ERPs to investigate this question across
  two experiments. Specifically, we tested whether orienting attention to a
  given spatial location within a VSTM representation resulted in modulation of
  the contralateral delay activity (CDA), a lateralized ERP marker of VSTM
  maintenance generated when participants selectively encode memory items from
  one hemifield. In both experiments, retrospective cues during the maintenance
  period could predict a specific item (spatial retrocue) ormultiple items
  (neutral retrocue) thatwould be probed at the end of thememory delay.Our
  results revealed that VSTM performance is significantly improved by orienting
  attention to the location of a task-relevant item. The behavioral benefit was
  accompanied by modulation of neural activity involved in VSTM maintenance.
  Spatial retrocues reduced the magnitude of the CDA, consistent with a
  reduction in memory load. Our results provide direct evidence that top-down
  control modulates neural activity associated with maintenance in VSTM, biasing
  competition in favor of the task-relevant information. © 2011 Massachusetts

  utilized behavioral accuracy, neural activity, and connectivity to explore the
  mechanism of VWM retention, little is known about the load-related changes in
  functional connectivity for hemi-field VWM retention. Methodology/Principal
  Findings: In this study, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 14
  normal young adults while they performed a bilateral visual field memory task.
  Subjects had more rapid and accurate responses to the left visual field (LVF)
  memory condition. The difference in mean amplitude between the ipsilateral and
  contralateral event-related potential (ERP) at parietal-occipital electrodes
  in retention interval period was obtained with six different memory loads.
  Functional connectivity between 128 scalp regions was measured by EEG phase
  synchronization in the theta- (4-8 Hz), alpha- (8-12 Hz), beta- (12-32 Hz),
  and gamma- (32-40 Hz) frequency bands. The resulting matrices were converted
  to graphs, and mean degree, clustering coefficient and shortest path length
  was computed as a function of memory load. The results showed that brain
  networks of theta-, alpha-, beta-, and gamma- frequency bands were
  load-dependent and visual-field dependent. The networks of theta- and alpha-
  bands phase synchrony were most predominant in retention period for right
  visual field (RVF) WM than for LVF WM. Furthermore, only for RVF memory
  condition, brain network density of theta-band during the retention interval
  were linked to the delay of behavior reaction time, and the topological
  property of alpha-band network was negative correlation with behavior
  accuracy. Conclusions/Significance: We suggest that the differences in theta-

  topological properties during retention period may result in the decline of

  attentional guidance by audiovisual stimuli in such an environment.
  Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured during visual search through
  dynamic displays consisting of line elements that randomly changed
  orientation. Search accuracy improved when a target orientation change was
  synchronized with an auditory signal as compared to when the auditory signal
  was absent or synchronized with a distractor orientation change. The ERP data
  show that behavioral benefits were related to an early multisensory
  interaction over left parieto-occipital cortex (50-60. ms post-stimulus
  onset), which was followed by an early positive modulation (80-100. ms) over
  occipital and temporal areas contralateral to the audiovisual event, an
  enhanced N2pc (210-250. ms), and a contralateral negative slow wave (CNSW).
  The early multisensory interaction was correlated with behavioral search
  benefits, indicating that participants with a strong multisensory interaction
  benefited the most from the synchronized auditory signal. We suggest that an
  auditory signal enhances the neural response to a synchronized visual event,

  track the number of objects held in memory, and contralateral signals that are
  independent of memory load. In MEG, unlike EEG, the contralateral interaction
  between hemisphere and item load is much weaker, suggesting that bilateral and
  contralateral markers of memory load reflect distinct sources to which EEG and

  the bilateral and the weaker contralateral capacity-limited responses to be
  localized, along with a load-independent contralateral signal. Sources of
  global and hemisphere-specific signals all localized to the posterior
  intraparietal sulcus during the early delay. However the bilateral load
  response peaked earlier and its generators shifted later in the delay.

  rotation is accomplished by transforming a representation held in visual

  index of the maintenance of information in VSTM. We hypothesized that if
  mental rotation is accomplished by transforming a representation held in VSTM,
  then the duration that this representation is maintained in VSTM should be
  related to the degree to which the representation must be rotated to reach the
  desired orientation. Therefore, the SPCN should offset at progressively longer
  latencies as the degree of rotation required increases. We tested this
  prediction in two experiments utilizing rotated alphanumeric characters.
  Experiment 1 utilized a normal versus mirror discrimination task that is known
  to require mental rotation. Experiment 2 utilized a letter versus digit
  discrimination, a task that does not require mental rotation. In Experiment 1,
  the offset latency of the SPCN wave increased with increases in the angle of
  rotation of the target. This effect indicates that targets were maintained in
  VSTM for longer durations as the angle of rotation increased. Experiment 2
  revealed that target orientation did not affect SPCN offset latency when
  subjects did not adopt a mental rotation strategy, confirming that the effects
  on the SPCN latency effects observed in Experiment 1 were not due to the mere

  increasing for storing highly discriminable simple objects. These results
  suggest that VWM can store the fine detailed information; however it can not
  store all the fine detailed information from 4 complex objects. It implies
  that the capacity of VWM is not only characterized by a fixed number of
  objects, there is at least one stage influenced by the detailed information
  contained in the objects. These results are further discussed within a

  VWM via two distinctive mechanisms. © ARVO.},

  (RT) are shorter for targets appearing at cued locations (valid trials) than
  at other locations (invalid trials). An increase in the amplitude of early P1
  and/or N1 event-related potential (ERP) components is also present for items
  appearing at cued locations, reflecting early attentional sensory gain control
  mechanisms. However, it is still unknown at which stage in the processing
  stream these early amplitude effects are translated into latency effects.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we measured the latency of two ERP
  components, the N2pc and the sustained posterior contralateral negativity
  (SPCN), to evaluate whether visual selection (as indexed by the N2pc) and
  visual-short term memory processes (as indexed by the SPCN) are delayed in
  invalid trials compared to valid trials. The P1 was larger contralateral to
  the cued side, indicating that attention was deployed to the cued location
  prior to the target onset. Despite these early amplitude effects, the N2pc
  onset latency was unaffected by cue validity, indicating an express,
  quasiinstantaneous re-engagement of attention in invalid trials. In contrast,
  latency effects were observed for the SPCN, and these were correlated to the
  RT effect. Conclusions/Significance: Results show that latency differences
  that could explain the RT cueing effects must occur after visual selection
  processes giving rise to the N2pc, but at or before transfer in visual
  short-term memory, as reflected by the SPCN, at least in discrimination tasks
  in which the target is presented concurrently with at least one distractor.
  Given that the SPCN was previously associated to conscious report, these

  Recent neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies have identified sustained

  in WM. In the present study, we present an electrophysiological measure of
  delay activity using event-related potentials (ERPs). Subjects were asked to
  remember the items in a single hemifield presented within a bilateral display.
  Approximately 200 msec following the onset of the memory array, we observed a
  large negative wave at electrode sites that were contralateral with respect to
  the position of the memory items. This activity persisted throughout the
  retention period and appears to be an analog to delay activity observed in
  monkey single-unit and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) WM
  studies. The contralateral delay activity is modulated by the number of items
  in the memory army but reaches asymptote for arrays of 3 to 4 items. This
  activity is similar across different classes of simple objects and the
  amplitude is smaller on incorrect response trials relative to correct trials,
  suggesting that this activity is necessary for correct performance on a given
  trial. Together, these results appear to indicate an electrophysiological

  targets could be discriminated both by their category (letters vs. digit) and
  by their colour (pink vs. green). Backward masking was produced by presenting
  a second pair of bilateral stimuli after the offset of the first pair. The
  second pair of stimuli consisted of characters of the same colour and category

  stimuli as in the backward masking condition, but by instructing subjects to
  report the second stimulus. The forward mask trials had longer response times
  compared to no-mask trials, and backward mask trials had even longer response
  times, and also a higher error rate. Although the different masking procedures
  lead to clear behavioural effects, the N2pc was not affected, suggesting that
  the deployment of visual spatial attention, per se, was not affected by
  pattern masking. A sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN)
  following the N2pc was also found (300 ms post-target, and beyond), and the
  amplitude of the SPCN was strongly modulated by the number of presented

  Single-cell research with non-human primates has shown that neuronal firing

  working memory. In humans, event-related potentials (ERPs) have been used to
  examine the maintenance of information in working memory. An event-related

  measure the maintenance of information in working memory “online” during a
  given trial. More recently, another ERP component, the contralateral delay

  human face, on whose appearance we easily form social judgments: Adults tend
  to attribute a certain personality to a stranger based on minimal facial cues,
  and after a short exposure time. Previous studies shed light on the cognitive
  and neural mechanisms underlying the ability to discriminate facial properties
  conveying social signals, but the underlying processes supporting individual
  differences remain poorly understood. In the current study, we explored
  whether differences in sensitivity to facial cues to trustworthiness and in
  representing such cues in a multidimensional space are associated with
  individual variability in social attitude, as measured by the
  extraversion/introversion dimension. Participants performed a task where they
  assessed the similarity between faces that varied in the level of
  trustworthiness, and multidimensional scaling analyses were performed to
  describe perceptual similarity in a multidimensional representational space.
  Extraversion scores impacted RTs, but not accuracy or face representation,
  making less extraverted individuals slower in detecting similarity of faces
  based on physical cues to trustworthiness. These findings are discussed from
  an ontogenetic perspective, where reduced social motivation might constrain
  perceptual attunement to social cues from faces, without affecting the
  structuring of the face representational space. © 2018 American Psychological

  regard may unintentionally vary in other ways, particularly if the correlation
  is a property of the population of faces. Here, we present an example of a
  correlation that arises from differences in the degree of sexual dimorphism.
  In Experiment 1, paired similarity ratings were collected for a set of 40 real
  face images chosen to vary in terms of gender and race (Asian vs. White).
  Multidimensional scaling (MDS) placed these stimuli in a "face space," with
  different attributes corresponding to different dimensions. Gender was found
  to vary more for White faces, resulting in a negative or positive correlation
  between gender and race when only considering male or only considering female
  faces. This increased sexual dimorphism for White faces may provide an
  alternative explanation for differences in face processing between White and
  Asian faces (e.g., the own-race bias, face attractiveness biases, etc.).
  Studies of face processing that are unconfounded by this difference in the
  degree of sexual dimorphism require stimuli that are decorrelated in terms of
  race and gender. Decorrelated faces were created using a morphing technique,
  spacing the morphs uniformly around a ring in the 2-dimensional (2D) race-
  gender plane. In Experiment 2, paired similarity ratings confirmed the 2D
  positions of the morph faces. In Experiment 3, race and gender category
  judgments varied uniformly for these decorrelated stimuli. Our results and
  stimuli should prove useful for studying sexual dimorphism and for the study
  of face processing more generally. © 2014 American Psychological Association.},

  controversial whether emotional picture content can influence a picture's

  autistic behaviours within a Bayesian framework, suggesting that individuals

  Here, using an established paradigm which manipulates the probability of
  stimulus repetition, we investigated the effect of perceptual expectation on

  traits. We predicted that the magnitude of the perceptual expectation effect
  would be negatively related to individual differences in autistic traits. We
  found a significant effect of perceptual expectation on RS in face-selective
  regions (i.e., greater RS when repetitions were expected relative to
  unexpected). However, there was no evidence of a relationship between autistic

  GLS approach, discussed here, can incorporate correlations among the outcomes
  within treatment groups and thus provide more accurate estimates. Also, it
  facilitates adjustment for covariates. In our approach, each study need not
  report all outcomes nor evaluate all treatments. For example, a meta-analysis
  may evaluate two or more treatments (one 'treatment' may be a control) and
  include all randomized controlled trials that report on any subset (of one or
  more) of the treatments of interest. The analysis omits other treatments that
  these trials evaluated but that are not of interest to the meta-analyst. In
  the proposed fixed-effects GLS regression model, study-level and
  treatment-arm-level covariates may be predictors of one or more of the
  outcomes. An analysis of rheumatoid arthritis data from trials of second-line
  drug treatments (used after initial standard therapies prove unsatisfactory
  for a patient) motivates and applies the method. Data from 44 randomized
  controlled trials were used to evaluate the effectiveness of injectable gold

  erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The covariates in the regression model were
  quality and duration of trial and baseline measures of the patients' disease
  severity and disease activity in each trial. The meta-analysis found that gold
  was significantly more effective than auranofin on all three treatment
  outcomes. For all estimated coefficients, the multiple-outcomes model produced
  moderate changes in their values and slightly smaller standard errors, to the
  three separate outcome models.},

  empirical, and theoretical bases on which a cognitive neuroscience approach to
  consciousness can be founded. We isolate three major empirical observations
  that any theory of consciousness should incorporate, namely (1) a considerable
  amount of processing is possible without consciousness, (2) attention is a
  prerequisite of consciousness, and (3) consciousness is required for some
  specific cognitive tasks, including those that require durable information
  maintenance, novel combinations of operations, or the spontaneous generation
  of intentional behavior. We then propose a theoretical framework that
  synthesizes those facts: the hypothesis of a global neuronal workspace. This
  framework postulates that, at any given time, many modular cerebral networks
  are active in parallel and process information in an unconscious manner. An
  information becomes conscious, however, if the neural population that
  represents it is mobilized by top-down attentional amplification into a
  brain-scale state of coherent activity that involves many neurons distributed
  throughout the brain. The long-distance connectivity of these 'workspace
  neurons' can, when they are active for a minimal duration, make the
  information available to a variety of processes including perceptual
  categorization, long-term memorization, evaluation, and intentional action. We
  postulate that this global availability of information through the workspace
  is what we subjectively experience as a conscious state. A complete theory of
  consciousness should explain why some cognitive and cerebral representations
  can be permanently or temporarily inaccessible to consciousness, what is the
  range of possible conscious contents, how they map onto specific cerebral
  circuits, and whether a generic neuronal mechanism underlies all of them. We
  confront the workspace model with those issues and identify novel experimental
  predictions. Neurophysiological, anatomical, and brain-imaging data strongly
  argue for a major role of prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and the areas
  that connect to them, in creating the postulated brain-scale workspace.

  behavioral performance was at chance level when they reported no visual

  of BOLD signal during the delay phase could classify presence versus absence
  of sample stimuli based on signal patterns in frontal cortex, and its spatial
  position based on signal patterns in occipital cortex. In addition, univariate
  analyses revealed increased BOLD signal change in prefrontal regions during
  memory recognition. Thus, our findings demonstrate short-term maintenance of

  the memory trace. In the present study, we dissociated fragile VSTM from
  visual working memory by showing a differentiation in their dependency on
  attention. A decrease in attention during presentation of the stimulus array
  greatly reduced the capacity of visual working memory, while this had only a
  small effect on the capacity of fragile VSTM. We conclude that fragile VSTM is
  a separate memory store from visual working memory. Thus, a tripartite
  division of VSTM appears to be in place, comprising iconic memory, fragile
  VSTM and visual working memory.},

  visual working memory (WM), such that information present in WM is thought to
  have necessarily been represented consciously. Recent work has challenged this
  longstanding view by demonstrating that visual stimuli rated by observers as
  unseen can nevertheless be maintained over a delay period. These experiments
  have been criticized, however, on the basis that subjective awareness ratings
  may contain response bias (e.g., an observer may report no awareness when in
  fact they had partial awareness). We mitigated this issue by investigating WM
  for visual stimuli that were matched for perceptual discrimination capacity
  (d'), yet which varied in subjective confidence ratings (so-called relative
  blindsight). If the degree of initial subjective awareness of a stimulus
  facilitates later maintenance of that information, WM performance should
  improve for stimuli encoded with higher confidence. In contrast, we found that
  WM performance did not benefit from higher visual discrimination confidence.
  This relationship was observed regardless of WM load (1 or 3). Insofar as
  metacognitive ratings (e.g., confidence, visibility) reflect visual awareness,
  these results challenge a strong relationship between conscious perception and
  WM using a paradigm that controls for discrimination accuracy and is less
  subject to response bias (since confidence is manipulated within subjects).
  Methodologically, we replicate prior efforts to induce relative blindsight
  using similar stimulus displays, providing a general framework for isolating
  metacognitive awareness in order to examine the function of consciousness. ©

  Substantial heterogeneity was explained by the stimulus type: the only threat

  only under specific presentation conditions. We also found that insufficiently
  rigorous awareness measures, inadequate control of response biases and low

  abstract = {Can we make progress exploring consciousness? Or is it forever
  beyond human reach? In science we never know the ultimate outcome of the
  journey. We can only take whatever steps our current knowledge affords. This
  paper explores today's evidence from the viewpoint of Global Workspace (GW)
  theory. 1 First, we ask what kind of evidence has the most direct bearing on
  the question. The answer given here is 'contrastive analysis' - a set of
  paired comparisons between similar conscious and unconscious processes. This
  body of evidence is already quite large, and constrains any possible theory
  (Baars, 1983; 1988; 1997). Because it involves both conscious and unconscious
  events, it deals directly with our own subjective experience, as anyone can
  tell by trying the demonstrations in this article. One dramatic contrast is
  between the vast number of unconscious neural processes happening in any given
  moment, compared to the very narrow bottleneck of conscious capacity. The
  narrow limits of consciousness have a compensating advantage: consciousness
  seems to act as a gateway, creating access to essentially any part of the
  nervous system. Even single neurons can be controlled by way of conscious
  feedback. Conscious experience creates access to the mental lexicon, to
  autobiographical memory, and to voluntary control over automatic action
  routines. Daniel C. Dennett has suggested that consciousness may itself be
  viewed as that to which 'we' have access. (Dennett, 1978) All these facts may
  be summed up by saying that. consciousness creates global access. How can we
  understand the evidence? The best answer today is a 'global workspace
  architecture', first developed by cognitive modelling groups led by Alan
  Newell and Herbert A. Simon. This mental architecture can be described
  informally as a working theatre. Working theatres are not just 'Cartesian'
  daydreams - they do real things, just like real theatres (Dennett \&
  Kinsbourne, 1992; Newell, 1990). They have a marked resemblance to other
  current accounts (e.g. Damasio, 1989; Gazzaniga, 1993; Shallice, 1988;
  Velmans, 1996). In the working theatre, focal consciousness acts as a 'bright
  spot' on the stage, directed there by the selective 'spotlight' of attention.
  The bright spot is further surrounded by a 'fringe,' of vital but vaguely
  conscious events (Mangan, 1993). The entire stage of the theatre corresponds
  to 'working memory', the immediate memory system in which we talk to
  ourselves, visualize places and people, and plan actions. Information from the
  bright spot is globally distributed through the theatre, to two classes of
  complex unconscious processors: those in the darkened theatre 'audience'
  mainly receive information from the bright spot; while 'behind the scenes',
  unconscious contextual systems shape events in the bright spot. One example of
  such a context is the unconscious philosophical assumptions with which we tend
  to approach the topic of consciousness. Another is the right parietal map that
  creates a spatial context for visual scenes (Kinsbourne, 1993). Baars
  (1983;1988; 1997) has developed these arguments in great detail, and aspects
  of this framework have now been taken up by others, such as the philosopher
  David Chalmers (1996). Some brain implications of the theory have been
  explored. Global Workspace (GW) theory provides the most useful framework to
  date for our rapidly accumulating body of evidence. It is consistent with our
  current knowledge, and can be enriched to include other aspects of human
  experience.}

  recorded neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants
  observed a bilateral shape-from-motion (SFM) display. While the display is in

  activity was sustained only in conditions associated with sustained awareness.
  Interestingly, the amplitude of the CDA was correlated with individual
  differences in visual awareness, suggesting that this activity plays a
  significant role in the maintenance of objects in consciousness. The CDA is
  typically associated with visual short-term memory (VSTM), suggesting that

  event-related brain potentials show a sustained negativity over posterior
  visual regions contralateral to the side wherememorized stimuli were
  presented. This contralateral delay activity (CDA) is generally believed to be
  a neural marker of working memory storage. In two experiments, we contrasted
  this storage account of the CDA with the alternative hypothesis that the CDA
  reflects the current focus of spatial attention on a subset of memorized items
  set up during the most recent encoding episode. We employed a sequential
  loading procedure where participants memorized four task-relevant items that
  were presented in two successive memory displays (M1 and M2). In both
  experiments, CDA components were initially elicited contralateral to
  taskrelevant items in M1. Critically, the CDA switched polarity when M2
  displays appeared on the opposite side. In line with the attentional
  activation account, these reversed CDA components exclusively reflected the
  number of items that were encoded from M2 displays, irrespective of how many
  M1 items were already held in working memory. On trials where M1 and M2
  displays were presented on the same side and on trials where M2 displays
  appeared nonlaterally, CDA components elicited in the interval after M2
  remained sensitive to a residual trace of M1 items, indicating that some
  activation of previously stored items was maintained across encoding episodes.
  These results challenge the hypothesis that CDA amplitudes directly reflect
  the total number of stored objects and suggest that the CDA is primarily
  sensitive to the activation of a subset of working memory representations

  abstract = {Visual working memory (VWM) guides behavior by holding a set of
  active representations and modifying them according to changes in the
  environment. This updating process relies on a unique mapping between each VWM
  representation and an actual object in the environment. Here, we destroyed
  this mapping by either presenting a coherent object but then breaking it into
  independent parts or presenting an object but then abruptly replacing it with
  a different object. This allowed us to introduce the neural marker and
  behavioral consequence of an online resetting process in humans' VWM. Across
  seven experiments, we demonstrate that this resetting process involves
  abandoning the old VWM contents because they no longer correspond to the
  objects in the environment. Then, VWM encodes the novel information and
  reestablishes the correspondence between the new representations and the
  objects. The resetting process was marked by a unique neural signature: a
  sharp drop in the amplitude of the electrophysiological index of VWM contents
  (the contralateral delay activity), presumably indicating the loss of the
  existent object-to-representation mappings. This marker was missing when an
  updating process occurred. Moreover, when tracking moving items, VWM failed to
  detect salient changes in the object's shape when these changes occurred
  during the resetting process. This happened despite the object being fully
  visible, presumably because the mapping between the object and a VWM
  representation was lost. Importantly, we show that resetting, its neural
  marker, and the behavioral cost it entails, are specific to situations that
  involve a destruction of the objects-to-representations correspondence.
  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Visual working memory (VWM) maintains task-relevant
  information in an online state. Previous studies showed that VWM
  representations are accessed and modified after changes in the environment.
  Here, we show that this updating process critically depends on an ongoing
  mapping between the representations and the objects in the environment. When
  this mapping breaks, VWM cannot access the old representations and instead
  resets. The novel resetting process that we introduce removes the existing
  representations instead of modifying them and this process is accompanied by a
  unique neural marker. During the resetting process, VWM was blind to salient
  changes in the object's shape. The resetting process highlights the
  flexibility of our cognitive system in handling the dynamic environment by
  abruptly abandoning irrelevant schemas.},

  attention within visual working memory? Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 28,
  2003–2020, 2016] proposed the alternative hypothesis that the CDA tracks the

  based on the finding that, when two successive arrays of memoranda were placed
  in opposite hemi-fields, CDA amplitude was primarily determined by the
  position and number of items in the second display, not the total memory load
  across both displays. Here, we considered the alternative interpretation that
  participants dropped the first array from WM when they encoded the second
  array because the format of the probe display was spatially incompatible with
  the initial sample display. In this case, even if the CDA indexes active
  storage rather than spatial attention, CDA activity would be determined by the
  second array. We tested this idea by directly manipulating the spatial
  compatibility of sample and probe displays. With spatially incompatible
  displays, we replicated Berggren and Eimer’s findings. However, with spatially
  compatible displays, we found clear evidence that CDA activity tracked the
  full storage load across both arrays, in line with a WM storage account of CDA
  activity. We propose that expectations of display compatibility influenced
  whether participants viewed the arrays as parts of a single extended event or

  changes, its representation is modified accordingly. VWM can either access and
  change the existing representation by an updating process, or it can reset, by
  encoding the object in its novel status as a new representation. Our goal was
  to show that the determining factor of updating versus resetting is the
  availability of a stable correspondence between the object and its VWM
  representation. Here, we demonstrate that updating relies on the
  object-to-representation mapping to access and modify the appropriate
  representation, while losing this mapping triggers a resetting process. We
  compared very similar situations of object separation that either allowed the
  mapping to hold, or caused it to be lost. When an object that was mapped to
  one representation separated, VWM reset, manifested by a sharp drop in the
  contralateral delay activity (CDA) amplitude (an electrophysiological marker
  of VWM contents; Experiment 1), and a behavioral cost to detect salient
  changes that co-occurred with the resetting-triggering event (Experiment 2).
  When each part was mapped to a different representation, the separation
  resulted in updating, with a gradual rise in CDA amplitude (Experiment 1), and
  a reduced behavioral cost (Experiment 2). Thus, while updating and resetting
  resulted in similar final representations (corresponding to the post-change
  objects), their dynamics were different, depending on the availability of the
  mapping. Our results reveal the triggering conditions of resetting and

  lateralization and contralateral delay activity (CDA) were analyzed as neural
  markers for visuospatial attention and visual WM storage, respectively. In the
  single-task condition, participants performed a grating change-detection task.
  To probe the role of visuospatial attention in maintaining WM contents, two
  color squares were presented above and below the fixation point during the
  retention interval, which remained visible until the detection display was
  present. In the dual-task condition, participants were required to maintain
  lateralized gratings while staring at the center-presented color squares, to
  detect possible subsequent color change. With this task, sustained
  visuospatial attention that guided to individual memory representations was
  disrupted. The behavioral data showed that, the insertion of secondary task
  significantly deteriorated WM performance. For electrophysiological data, we
  divided the retention interval into two stages, the early stage and late
  stage, bounded by the onset of the secondary task. We found that CDA amplitude
  was lower under the dual-task condition than the single-task condition during
  the late stage, but not the early stage, and the extent to which CDA reduced
  tracked the impaired memory performance at the individual level. Also, alpha
  lateralization only could be observed in the single-task condition of the late
  stage, and completely disappeared in the dual-task condition, indicating the
  disruption of visuospatial attention directed to memory representations.
  Individuals who experienced greater visuospatial attention disruption, as
  indicated by the alpha lateralization, had lower maintenance-associated neural
  activity (CDA), and suffered greater impairment of memory performance. These

  that shape, regardless of whether its initial presentation had been
  supraliminal or subliminal. We demonstrate this with neural and behavioral

  Experiment 2, participants were first presented with a masked faces six times
  during encoding. Three minutes later, they were asked to make a
  fearful/neutral judgment for the same face with congruent expression, the same
  face with incongruent expression or a new face. Participants showed a
  significant priming effect for the fearful faces but not for the neutral
  faces, regardless of their awareness of the masked faces during encoding.
  These results provided evidence that unconsciously processed stimuli could
  enhance emotional memory after both short and long delays. It indicates that
  emotion can enhance memory processing whether the stimuli are encoded
  consciously or unconsciously. © 2011 Yang et al.},

  short-term memory (VSTM) interference by irrelevant perceptual input. These
  studies, however, presented distracters that were subjected to conscious
  scrutiny by participants thus strongly involving attentional control
  mechanisms. In order to minimize the role of attentional control and to
  investigate interference occurring at the level of sensory representations, we
  developed a paradigm in which a subliminal visual distracter is presented
  during the delay period of a visual short-term memory task requiring the
  maintenance of stimulus orientation. This subliminal distracter could be
  either congruent or incongruent with the orientation of the memory item.
  Behavioral results showed that the intervening distracter affected the
  fidelity of VSTM when it was incongruent with the memory cue. We then assessed
  the causal role of the early visual cortex in this interaction by using
  transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We found that occipital TMS impaired
  the fidelity VSTM content in the absence of the memory mask. Interestingly,
  TMS facilitated VSTM performance in the presence of a subliminal memory mask
  that was incongruent with the memory content. Signal detection analyses
  indicated that TMS did not modulate perceptual sensitivity of the masked
  distracter. That the impact of TMS on the precision of VSTM was dissociated by
  the presence vs. absence of a subliminal perceptual distracter and its
  congruency with the VSTM content provides causal evidence for the view that
  competitive interactions between memory and perception can occur at the
  earliest cortical stages of visual processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

  disruption of reentrant signaling to low-level visual cortical areas. In OSM,
  a visual stimulus array is briefly presented that includes a parafoveal visual
  target denoted by a cue, typically consisting of several surrounding dots.
  When the offset of the target-surrounding cue dots is delayed relative to the
  rest of the array, a striking reduction in the perception of the target image
  surrounded by the dots is observed. Using faces and houses as the target
  stimuli, we found that successful OSM reduced or eliminated all the measured
  electrophysiological indices of visual processing stages after 130. ms
  post-stimulus. More specifically, when targets were missed within the masked
  condition (i.e., on trials with effective OSM that disrupted awareness), we
  observed fully intact early feed-forward processing up through the visual
  extrastriate P1 ERP component peaking at 100. ms, followed by reduced
  low-level activity over the occipital pole 130-170. ms post-stimulus, reduced

  which disease mechanisms are incompletely understood. The discovery of
  disease-associated proteins with causal genetic evidence provides an
  opportunity to identify new therapeutic targets. Methods: We investigated the
  observational and causal associations of 90 cardiovascular proteins, which
  were measured using affinity-based proteomic assays. First, we estimated the
  associations of 90 cardiovascular proteins with incident heart failure by
  means of a fixed-effect meta-analysis of 4 population-based studies, composed
  of a total of 3019 participants with 732 HF events. The causal effects of
  HF-associated proteins were then investigated by Mendelian randomization,
  using cis-protein quantitative loci genetic instruments identified from
  genomewide association studies in more than 30 000 individuals. To improve the
  precision of causal estimates, we implemented an Mendelian randomization model
  that accounted for linkage disequilibrium between instruments and tested the
  robustness of causal estimates through a multiverse sensitivity analysis that
  included up to 120 combinations of instrument selection parameters and
  Mendelian randomization models per protein. The druggability of candidate
  proteins was surveyed, and mechanism of action and potential on-target side
  effects were explored with cross-trait Mendelian randomization analysis.
  Results: Forty-four of ninety proteins were positively associated with risk of
  incident HF (P<6.0×10-4). Among these, 8 proteins had evidence of a causal
  association with HF that was robust to multiverse sensitivity analysis: higher
  CSF-1 (macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1), Gal-3 (galectin-3) and KIM-1
  (kidney injury molecule 1) were positively associated with risk of HF, whereas
  higher ADM (adrenomedullin), CHI3L1 (chitinase-3-like protein 1), CTSL1
  (cathepsin L1), FGF-23 (fibroblast growth factor 23), and MMP-12 (matrix
  metalloproteinase-12) were protective. Therapeutics targeting ADM and Gal-3
  are currently under evaluation in clinical trials, and all the remaining
  proteins were considered druggable, except KIM-1. Conclusions: We identified
  44 circulating proteins that were associated with incident HF, of which 8
  showed evidence of a causal relationship and 7 were druggable, including
  adrenomedullin, which represents a particularly promising drug target. Our
  approach demonstrates a tractable roadmap for the triangulation of population
  genomic and proteomic data for the prioritization of therapeutic targets for

  while applying alternative analytic constraints on the model specification

  media) separately rather than lumping all "screen time" including TV together;
  2) examining boys and girls separately, rather than examining them together;
  3) excluding potential mediators from the list of controls; and 4) treating
  scales equally (rather than allowing one scale with many subscales to dominate
  all others). We were able to reproduce the original results with the original

  larger relationships than previously reported. In particular: among girls,
  there is a consistent and substantial association between mental health and

  DSM-5 hinges on a relationship between 5 or more IGD symptoms and “clinically
  significant impairment and/or distress”, to date most studies have focused on
  statistical significance. To address this, we conduct an individual
  participant meta-analysis comprised of primary data from 15 studies (n =
  38,851). Study 1 finds that meeting the DSM-5's proposed 5/9 diagnostic
  threshold is associated with d = .65 greater distress across 21 well-being
  constructs, which exceeds a conservative anchor for clinical significance.
  However, we also find that classifying participants above and below the 5/9
  threshold has little power to reject that threshold: a 2/9 cut-off predicts
  similarly large differences. Study 2 shows that dimensional (continuous)
  modelling of IGD scores offers a more severe test of the proposed threshold.
  Finally, study 3 reveals that three criteria—preoccupation, tolerance, and
  loss of control—are roughly half as predictive of distress as withdrawal and
  escapism, highlighting limitations also present in dimensional modelling and
  suggesting the need to modify or remove these. In sum, we do not find evidence
  for invalidating IGD as proposed, but do identify issues with threshold-based
  categorization, inadequate differentiation between statistical and clinical
  significance, and the inclusion of potentially flawed criteria. We argue that
  these are possible negative consequences of a premature switch to confirmatory

  reported relationship between OC use and depression risk. Insight into the
  impact of analytical choices on the association is important when interpreting
  available evidence. Hence, we examined the association between adolescent OC
  use and subsequent depression risk in early adulthood analyzing all
  theoretically justifiable models. METHODS: Data from the prospective cohort
  study TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, among women aged 13-25
  years were used. Adolescent OC use (ages 16-19 years) was used as a predictor
  and major depressive disorder (MDD) in early adulthood (ages 20-25 years), as
  assessed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV
  oriented Lifetime Depression Assessment Self-Report and the Composite
  International Diagnostic Interview, was used as an outcome. A total of 818
  analytical models were analyzed using Specification Curve Analysis in 534
  adolescent OC users and 191 nonusers. RESULTS: Overall, there was an
  association of adolescent OC use and an episode of MDD in early adulthood
  [median odds ratio (OR)median = 1.41; ORmin = 1.08; ORmax = 2.18, p < .001],
  which was driven by the group of young women with no history of MDD (ORmedian
  = 1.72; ORmin = 1.21; ORmax = 2.18, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In summary,
  adolescent OC use was associated with a small but robust increased risk for
  experiencing an episode of MDD, especially among women with no history of MDD
  in adolescence. Understanding the potential side effects of OCs will help
  women and their doctors to make informed choices when deciding among possible

  majority of studies that investigated this relationship showed a negative
  correlation, indicating lower cognitive abilities of individuals reporting
  stronger religious beliefs. Although the effect direction has been observed to
  be largely consistent across studies, the reported effect strength varied
  substantially across studies. Several potentially moderating variables such as
  different intelligence and religiosity assessment methods, educational status
  of samples, and participant sex have been proposed as likely candidates for
  explaining systematic differences in effect strengths. However, the effects of
  these moderators are to date unclear. Consequently, we focused in
  investigating effects of these moderating variables on the intelligence and
  religiosity link in an update of prior meta-analytical investigations in n =
  89 (k = 105; N = 201,457) studies. Random-effects analyses showed a small but

  ratings is due to heterogeneity in the sample, we conducted post hoc subgroup
  analyses by splitting the data according to stimulation side and sex
  (between-subject factors) as well as caloric density, perceived healthiness,
  and flavor (sweet vs. savory) of the food (within-subject factors). This
  multiverse analysis largely supported the absence of taVNS-induced changes

  areas of robustness are highlighted. Methods and analysis We will conduct
  systematic literature searches in bibliographical databases (PubMed, Embase,

  We will include all RCTs comparing a psychological treatment with a control
  condition. We will include studies published in English, German, Spanish or

  stringent pre-registered in-vestigation of the claim that there exists a level
  of linguistic representation that “includes syntactic category information but
  not semantic information” (Branigan \& Pickering, 2017: 8). As a test case, we
  focussed on the English passive; a construction for which previous findings
  have been somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, several studies using
  different methodologies have found an advantage for theme-experiencer passives
  (e.g., The girl was shocked by the tiger; and also agent-patient passives;
  e.g., The girl was hit by the tiger) over experiencer-theme passives (e.g.,
  The girl was ignored by the tiger). On the other hand, Messenger et al. (2012)
  found no evidence that theme-experiencer and experiencer-theme passives vary
  in their propensity to prime production of agent-patient passives. We
  therefore conducted an online replication of Messen-ger et al (2012) with a
  pre-registered appropriately powered sample (N=240). Although a large and
  significant priming effect (i.e., an effect of prime sentence type) was
  ob-served, a Bayesian analysis yielded only weak/anecdotal evidence (BF=2.11)
  for the crucial interaction of verb type by prime type; a finding that was
  robust to different coding and exclusion decisions, operationalizations of
  verb semantics (dichoto-mous/continuous), analysis frameworks
  (Bayesian/frequentist) and - as per a mixed-effects-multiverse analyses -
  random effects structures. Nevertheless, these findings do no not provide
  evidence for the absence of semantic effects (as has been argued for the
  findings of Messenger et al, 2012). We conclude that these and related
  findings are best explained by a model that includes both lexical,
  exemplar-level representations and rep-resentations at multiple higher levels

  several studies have suggested that this circuitry exhibits functional changes

  resulting from differences in analytic choices across studies. Here we used
  multiverse analyses to examine the robustness of task-based amygdala-mPFC
  function findings to analytic choices within the context of an accelerated
  longitudinal design (4-22 years-old; N = 98; 183 scans; 1-3
  scans/participant). Participants recruited from the greater Los Angeles area
  completed an event-related emotional face (fear, neutral) task. Parallel
  analyses varying in preprocessing and modeling choices found that age-related
  change estimates for amygdala reactivity were more robust than task-evoked
  amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity to varied analytical choices.
  Specification curves indicated evidence for age-related decreases in amygdala
  reactivity to faces, though within-participant changes in amygdala reactivity
  could not be differentiated from between-participant differences. In contrast,
  amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity results varied across methods much more,
  and evidence for age-related change in amygdala-mPFC connectivity was not
  consistent. Generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) measurements of
  connectivity were especially sensitive to whether a deconvolution step was
  applied. Our findings demonstrate the importance of assessing the robustness
  of findings to analysis choices, although the age-related changes in our
  current work cannot be overinterpreted given low test-retest reliability.
  Together, these findings highlight both the challenges in estimating
  developmental change in longitudinal cohorts and the value of multiverse
  approaches in developmental neuroimaging for assessing robustness of results.},

  stress and common EF, with a smaller association for high-income participants.
  Additionally, we conducted a specification-curve analysis on the association
  between chronic stress and EF to assess the influence of different analysis
  choices on results in our dataset. This analysis confirmed the absence of a
  coherent association between chronic stress and EF by showing that the
  majority of analytical choices produced null effects and only a small number
  of analytical choices produced meaningful associations (negative or positive).
  Taken together, our findings suggest that common EF likely remains preserved
  under the influence of chronic stress. Our specification-curve analysis,
  however, also shows that chronic stress may also have either a positive or a
  negative effect on EF, depending on the choice of covariates and measures of
  chronic stress and EF. Consequently, more research on the role of these
  factors for the association between chronic stress and EF is needed to avoid
  the interpretation of non-replicable stress-EF associations caused by

  different methodological choices on data quality and experimental effects
  (correct vs. error trials) at several key stages: highpass filtering, lowpass
  filtering, ocular artifact correction, reference, baseline adjustment, scoring
  sensors, and measurement procedure. This multiverse analysis yielded 3,456 ERN
  scores and 576 Pe scores per person. An optimized pipeline for ERN included a

  Through out-of-sample prediction, model comparisons and specification curve
  analyses, we find that the moral contagion model performs no better than an

  intergroup polarization and conflict. Partisan attitudes toward the elected
  leader can also shift from before to after an election, but the biology
  underlying these attitudinal shifts remains largely unknown. An important
  factor could be the hormone testosterone, which is theorized to fluctuate
  during competition and to influence status seeking. In a naturalistic study of
  113 registered voters, we measured changes in testosterone levels and
  attitudes toward the winner of the 2012 US Presidential Election. We found
  that supporters of the losing candidate (Mitt Romney) showed acute increases
  in testosterone levels compared to supporters of the winner (Barack Obama) on
  the evening of Election Day. Supporters of the losing candidate also
  demonstrated flatter diurnal testosterone slopes on Election Day that
  persisted up to two days after the election. Furthermore, greater increases in
  acute testosterone levels and flatter diurnal slopes among supporters of the
  losing candidate were associated with less positive evaluations of the winning
  candidate. These testosterone-moderated attitudinal shifts observed in the
  days after the election showed a directionally similar pattern with a weaker
  effect size six months later. Finally, we confirmed that the main results were
  robust to alternative data analytic choices using multiverse specification
  curve analysis. The findings from this paper suggest that hormonal responses

  predictive of people's policy-related attitudes (e.g., voting intentions).
  Further, a field experiment based on a national expert report on 5G (N = 839

  given moment. In their daily lives, people often behave the way they typically
  do (they enact trait-congruent personality states), but occasionally behave
  differently from how they typically do (trait-incongruent personality states).
  Several theories propose that such incongruent personality states should be
  associated with undesirable outcomes such as less positive affect or more
  tiredness, but the current state of evidence is inconclusive and mostly based
  on one personality dimension: extraversion. In this study, we contribute to
  filling important gaps in the literature by examining congruence of
  personality dimensions other than extraversion, considering characteristics of
  the situation, and modeling congruence with state-of-the-art response surface
  analyses. We aimed to manipulate state honesty-humility and state
  agreeableness as well as perceived adversity and deception of the situation in
  a prisoner's dilemma paradigm. The manipulations mostly had the intended
  effects but they also had additional unspecific effects on other personality
  states and situation characteristics. The study thus emphasized the difficulty
  of manipulating personality states, situation characteristics, and trait-state
  and state-situation congruence. In pre-registered analyses of variance,
  response surface analyses, and specification curve analyses, we then examined
  how trait-state congruence and state-situation congruence were associated with
  positive affect, tiredness, and performance in a numerical Stroop task.
  Neither trait-state congruence nor state-situation congruence were associated
  with positive affect, tiredness, or cognitive performance. However, in light
  of this study's limitations, more studies that are carefully designed,
  carefully operationalized, and well-powered are needed to examine trait-state
  and state-situation congruence. Because experimental research can advance the
  understanding of personality dynamics substantially, future research should
  additionally further aim to develop valid and reliable manipulations of
  personality states and situation characteristics. © This is an open-access

  task, in which participants chose between performing low-demand and
  high-demand variants of a task-switching paradigm. We found that acute stress
  indeed increased participants' preference for less demanding behavior, whereas
  task-switching performance remained intact. Additional Bayesian and multiverse

  data filtering, feature operationalization and selection, model specification,
  and parametric assumptions. "Multiverse Analysis"research has shown that a
  lack of exploration of these decisions can lead to non-robust conclusions
  based on highly sensitive decision points. Importantly, even if myopic
  analyses are technically correct, analysts' focus on one set of decision
  points precludes them from exploring alternate formulations that may produce
  very different results. Prior work has also shown that analysts' exploration
  is often limited based on their training, domain, and personal experience.
  However, supporting analysts in exploring alternative approaches is
  challenging and typically requires expert feedback that is costly and hard to
  scale. Here, we formulate the tasks of identifying decision points and
  suggesting alternative analysis approaches as a classification task and a
  sequence-to-sequence prediction task, respectively. We leverage public
  collective data analysis knowledge in the form of code submissions to the
  popular data science platform Kaggle to build the first predictive model which
  supports Multiverse Analysis. Specifically, we mine this code repository for
  70k small differences between 40k submissions, and demonstrate that these
  differences often highlight key decision points and alternative approaches in
  their respective analyses.We leverage information on relationships within
  libraries through neural graph representation learning in a multitask learning
  framework. We demonstrate that our model, MULTIVERSE, is able to correctly
  predict decision points with up to 0.81 ROC AUC, and alternative code snippets
  with up to 50.3\% GLEU, and that it performs favorably compared to a suite of
  baselines and ablations. We show that when our model has perfect information
  about the location of decision points, say provided by the analyst, its
  performance increases significantly from 50.3\% to 73.4\% GLEU. Finally, we
  show through a human evaluation that real data analysts find alternatives
  provided by MULTIVERSE to be more reasonable, acceptable, and syntactically
  correct than alternatives from comparable baselines, including other

  abstract = {Gaming disorder (also known as dysregulated gaming) has received
  significant research and policy attention based on concerns that certain
  patterns of play are associated with decreased mental well-being and/or
  functional impairment. In this study, we use specification curve analysis to
  examine analytical flexibility and the strength of the relationship between
  dysregulated gaming and well-being in the form of general mental health,
  depressive mood and life satisfaction. Dutch and Flemish gamers (n = 424)
  completed an online survey containing five unique dysregulated gaming measures
  (covering nine scale variants) and three well-being measures. We find a
  consistent negative relationship; across 972 justifiable regression models,
  the median standardized regression coefficient was -0.39 (min: -0.54, max:
  -0.19). Data show that the majority of dysregulated gaming operationalizations
  converge upon highly similar estimates of well-being. However, variance is
  introduced by the choice of well-being measure; results indicate that
  dysregulated gaming is more strongly associated with depressive mood than with
  life satisfaction. Weekly game time accounted for little to no unique variance
  in well-being in the sample. We argue that research on this topic should
  compare a broad range of psychosocial well-being outcomes and explore possible
  simplifications of the DSM-5 gaming disorder criteria. Given somewhat minute
  differences between dysregulated gaming scales when used in survey-based
  studies and largely equivalent relationships with mental health indicators,
  harmonization of measurement should be a priority.},

  driving experiences in 2015. The original analysis was implemented as
  described in the original report. An MRA approach was used to evaluate the

  adolescents' risk-taking (indexed by motor vehicle crash involvement) to
  different reasonable methodological choices. We enumerated 6 reasonable choice

  associations with symptomatology in individuals with serious mental illness.
  Objective: To determine the range of associations between screen time and
  symptoms of individuals with mental illness, we utilized a method called
  specification curve analysis. Methods: In this observational study, we
  recruited smartphone-owning adults (≥18 years old) with schizophrenia and
  healthy controls. We installed 2 research-source smartphone apps, mindLAMP and
  Beiwe, to collect survey results, cognitive test results, and screen time
  metrics over a period of 3 months. Surveys were scheduled for twice a week,
  but participants were instructed to take the surveys naturally as much or as
  little as they wanted. Screen time was collected continuously in the
  background. A total of 140 participants was recruited from the outpatient
  clinic population as well as through general public advertising. Age-matched,
  smartphone-owning healthy controls were also part of the recruitment pool. A
  specification curve analysis was a priori designed to explore the relationship
  between every combination of independent variable and dependent variable in
  order to demonstrate to what degree screen time relates to symptoms in
  individuals with serious mental illness. Results: The sample consisted of 88
  participants (54 with schizophrenia and 34 healthy controls) who completed
  both the initial and follow-up visits, completed at least one self-reported
  survey, and had a minimum passive data cutoff of 5 consecutive days. While we
  found an association between smartphone screen time metrics and cognition
  (adjusted R2=0.107, P<.001), specification curve analysis revealed a wide
  range of heterogenous associations with screen time from very negative to very
  positive. The effects differed based on diagnostic group, age bracket, type of
  regression model used, and the specific independent and dependent variables
  selected for analysis. Conclusions: The associations between screen time and
  mental health in patients with schizophrenia are heterogenous when examined
  with methods that reduce analytical bias. The heterogeneity in associations
  suggests that complex and personalized potential effects must be understood in
  the greater context of an individual. This analysis of longitudinally
  collected screen time data shows potential for future research that could

  life-history advantages (e.g. higher reproductive output) that are often

  series of candidate correlates, yet the strength and robustness of their
  associations remain unclear because of disparate operationalizations of risk
  preference and analytic limitations in past research. We addressed these
  issues with a study involving several operationalizations of risk preference
  (all collected from each participant in a diverse sample of the German
  population; N = 916), and by adopting an exhaustive modeling
  approach-specification curve analysis. Our analyses of 6 candidate correlates
  (household income, sex, age, fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence,
  years of education) suggest that sex and age have robust and consistent
  associations with risk preference, whereas the other candidate correlates show
  weaker and more (domain-) specific associations (except for crystallized
  intelligence, for which there were no robust associations). The results
  further demonstrate the important role of construct operationalization when
  assessing people's risk preferences: Self-reported propensity measures picked
  up various associations with the proposed correlates, but (incentivized)
  behavioral measures largely failed to do so. In short, the associations
  between the 6 candidate correlates and risk preference depend mostly on how
  risk preference is measured, rather than whether and which control variables

  assessments of depression/anxiety symptoms and pubertal development,
  subjective pubertal timing, and date of menarche. Their parents/guardians also
  reported on the adolescent's pubertal development and subjective pubertal
  timing. We assessed salivary dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, and
  estradiol levels and conducted clinical interviews to determine the presence
  of case level internalizing disorders. From these data, we computed 11
  measures of pubertal timing at both time points, as well as seven measures of
  internalizing psychopathology, and entered these in a Specification Curve
  Analysis. Overall, earlier pubertal timing was associated with increased
  internalizing psychopathology. Associations were stronger prospectively than
  concurrently, suggesting that timing of early pubertal processes might be
  especially important for later risk of mental illness. Associations were
  strongest when pubertal timing was based on the Tanner Stage Line Drawings and
  when the outcome was case-level Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
  Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) depression or Hierarchical Taxonomy of
  Psychopathology (HiTOP) distress disorders. Timing based on hormone levels was
  not associated with internalizing psychopathology, suggesting that
  psychosocial mechanisms, captured by timing measures of visible physical

  psychopathology than biological ones in adolescent girls. Future research

  abstract = {There is an increasing awareness that replication should become
  common practice in empirical studies. However, study results might fail to
  replicate for various reasons. The robustness of published study results can
  be assessed using the relatively new multiverse-analysis methodology, in which
  the robustness of the effect estimates against data analytical decisions is
  assessed. However, the uptake of multiverse analysis in empirical studies
  remains low, which might be due to the scarcity of guidance available on
  performing multiverse analysis. Researchers might experience difficulties in
  identifying data analytical decisions and in summarizing the large number of
  effect estimates yielded by a multiverse analysis. These difficulties are
  amplified when applying multiverse analysis to assess the robustness of the
  effect estimates from a mediation analysis, as a mediation analysis involves
  more data analytical decisions than a bivariate analysis. The aim of this
  paper is to provide an overview and worked example of the use of multiverse
  analysis to assess the robustness of the effect estimates from a mediation
  analysis. We showed that the number of data analytical decisions in a
  mediation analysis is larger than in a bivariate analysis. By using a
  real-life data example from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, we
  demonstrated the application of multiverse analysis to a mediation analysis.
  This included the use of specification curves to determine the impact of data
  analytical decisions on the magnitude and statistical significance of the
  direct, indirect, and total effect estimates. Although the multiverse analysis
  methodology is still relatively new and future research is needed to further
  advance this methodology, this paper shows that multiverse analysis is a
  useful method for the assessment of the robustness of the direct, indirect,
  and total effect estimates in a mediation analysis and thereby to inform
  replication studies.},

  requires compliance from the public. This study aimed to examine
  cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of trust in government regarding
  COVID-19 control with the adoption of recommended health behaviours and
  prosocial behaviours, and potential determinants of trust in government during
  the pandemic. METHODS: This study analysed data from the PsyCorona Survey, an
  international project on COVID-19 that included 23 733 participants from 23
  countries (representative in age and gender distributions by country) at
  baseline survey and 7785 participants who also completed follow-up surveys.
  Specification curve analysis was used to examine concurrent associations
  between trust in government and self-reported behaviours. We further used
  structural equation model to explore potential determinants of trust in
  government. Multilevel linear regressions were used to examine associations
  between baseline trust and longitudinal behavioural changes. RESULTS: Higher
  trust in government regarding COVID-19 control was significantly associated
  with higher adoption of health behaviours (handwashing, avoiding crowded
  space, self-quarantine) and prosocial behaviours in specification curve
  analyses (median standardised β = 0.173 and 0.229, p < 0.001). Government
  perceived as well organised, disseminating clear messages and knowledge on
  COVID-19, and perceived fairness were positively associated with trust in
  government (standardised β = 0.358, 0.230, 0.056, and 0.249, p < 0.01). Higher
  trust at baseline survey was significantly associated with lower rate of
  decline in health behaviours over time (p for interaction = 0.001).
  CONCLUSIONS: These results highlighted the importance of trust in government
  in the control of COVID-19.},

  A scoping literature review indicated inconsistent effects, arguably

  sample of n = 3, 659 parents collected in partnership with a national public
  broadcaster, we conducted a multiverse analysis. We explored 84 different
  analytic choices to address whether associations were weak versus robust, and
  provide clearer direction for measurement, theory, and practice. Effects were
  assessed in relation to p values, effect sizes, and AIC; we further conducted
  a meta-analytic sensitivity check. Results: Direct associations between
  smartphone use and parenting were relatively weak and mixed. Instead, the
  relation between use and parenting depended on level of technological
  interference. This pattern was particularly robust for family displacement. At
  low levels of displacing time with family using technology, more smartphone
  use was associated with better (not worse) parenting. Conclusions: Our results
  indicate fragility in findings of risks for parental smartphone use on
  parenting; there were few concerns in this regard. Rather, at low levels of
  technological interference, more phone use was associated with higher
  parenting quality. Scholars should avoid generalized narratives of family risk

  reflecting that people's worst task performance shows numerically stronger

  However, recent meta-analytic work has proposed this be renamed the "not-best

  ability to similar degrees, with both predicting ability better than best
  performance. We re-analyzed data from a previously published latent-variable
  study to test for worst vs. not-best performance across a variety of reaction
  time tasks in relation to two cognitive ability constructs: working memory
  capacity (WMC) and propensity for task-unrelated thought (TUT). Using two
  methods of assessing worst performance-ranked-binning and ex-Gaussian-modeling
  approaches-we found evidence for both the worst and not-best performance
  rules. WMC followed the not-best performance rule (correlating equivalently
  with mean and longest response times (RTs)) but TUT propensity followed the
  worst performance rule (correlating more strongly with longest RTs).
  Additionally, we created a mini-multiverse following different outlier
  exclusion rules to test the robustness of our findings; our findings remained
  stable across the different multiverse iterations. We provisionally conclude
  that the worst performance rule may only arise in relation to cognitive
  abilities closely linked to (failures of) sustained attention.},

  abstract = {The sustaining environments hypothesis refers to the popular idea,
  stemming from theories in developmental, cognitive, and educational
  psychology, that the long-term success of early educational interventions is
  contingent on the quality of the subsequent learning environment. Several
  studies have investigated whether specific kindergarten classroom and other
  elementary school factors account for patterns of persistence and fadeout of
  early educational interventions. These analyses focus on the statistical
  interaction between an early educational intervention – usually whether the
  child attended preschool – and several measures of the quality of the
  subsequent educational environment. The key prediction of the sustaining
  environments hypothesis is a positive interaction between these two variables.
  To quantify the strength of the evidence for such effects, we meta-analyze
  existing studies that have attempted to estimate interactions between
  preschool and later educational quality in the United States. We then attempt
  to establish the consistency of the direction and a plausible range of
  estimates of the interaction between preschool attendance and subsequent
  educational quality by using a specification curve analysis in a large,
  nationally representative dataset that has been used in several recent studies
  of the sustaining environments hypothesis. The meta-analysis yields small
  positive interaction estimates ranging from approximately 0.00 to 0.04,
  depending on the specification. The specification curve analyses yield
  interaction estimates of approximately 0. Results suggest that the current mix
  of methods used to test the sustaining environments hypothesis cannot reliably
  detect realistically sized effects. Our recommendations are to combine large
  sample sizes with strong causal identification strategies, and to study
  combinations of interventions that have a strong probability of showing large
  main effects. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

  failure predict success in a similar manner. Following 174 Navy SEALs
  candidates, we find that, even in this extreme setting, stress-is-enhancing
  mindsets predict greater persistence through training, faster obstacle course
  times, and fewer negative evaluations from peers and instructors. We also find
  evidence that failure-is-enhancing mindsets may be detrimental to candidates'
  success, and non-limited willpower mindsets prompt negative evaluations from
  others. Multiverse analyses were conducted to test for the robustness of these
  effects across researcher analytical decisions, which produced consistent
  results. We discuss how findings in this unique environment can provide
  insight into the importance of mindsets in other organizations and propose
  future avenues of research to further understand the causal role of mindsets

  many adolescents worldwide. However, the increasing amount of time spent on
  these games each day raised fears that this comes at the expense of school

  research, the present study on a sample of N = 3,554 German adolescents (56\%
  girls) adopted a prospective design and examined the effects of the time
  playing computer games each day on grades and domain-specific competences in
  mathematics and reading over time. Robust polynomial regressions combined with
  specification curve analyses showed that longer gaming times predicted worse
  grades 2 years later. These results could be replicated after controlling for
  initial grades and reasoning abilities. In contrast, mathematical and reading
  competences were not affected by gaming times. Thus, playing computer and
  video games can result in a noticeably, albeit small, loss of educational
  returns, but it does not affect basic competences. (PsycINFO Database Record

  gain more insight into this problem, we used Specification-Curve Analysis
  (SCA) to investigate the influence of methodological variation on
  biomarker-based cluster-analysis results. METHODS: Proteomics data (31
  biomarkers) were used from patients (n = 688) and healthy controls (n = 426)
  in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. In SCAs, consistency of
  results was evaluated across 1200 k-means and hierarchical clustering
  analyses, each with a unique combination of the clustering algorithm,
  fit-index, and distance metric. Next, SCAs were run in simulated datasets with
  varying cluster numbers and noise/outlier levels to evaluate the effect of
  data properties on SCA outcomes. RESULTS: The real data SCA showed no robust
  patterns of biological clustering in either the MDD or a combined MDD/healthy
  dataset. The simulation results showed that the correct number of clusters
  could be identified quite consistently across the 1200 model specifications,
  but that correct cluster identification became harder when the number of
  clusters and noise levels increased. CONCLUSION: SCA can provide useful
  insights into the presence of clusters in biomarker data. However, SCA is
  likely to show inconsistent results in real-world biomarker datasets that are
  complex and contain considerable levels of noise. Here, the number and nature
  of the observed clusters may depend strongly on the chosen
  model-specification, precluding conclusions about the existence of biological
  clusters among psychiatric patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Throughout the developed world, adolescents are
  growing up with increased access to and engagement with a range of
  screen-based technologies, allowing them to encounter ideas and people on a
  global scale from the intimacy of their bedroom. The concerns about digital
  technologies negatively influencing sleep are therefore especially noteworthy,
  as sleep has been proven to greatly affect both cognitive and emotional
  well-being. The associations between digital engagement and adolescent sleep
  should therefore be carefully investigated in research adhering to the highest
  methodological standards. This understood, studies published to date have not
  often done so and have instead focused mainly on data derived from general
  retrospective self-report questionnaires. The value of this work has been
  called into question by recent research showing that retrospective
  questionnaires might fail to accurately measure these variables of interest.
  Novel and diverse approaches to measurement are therefore necessary for
  academic study to progress. METHODS: This study analyses data from 11,884
  adolescents included in the UK Millennium Cohort Study to examine the
  association between digital engagement and adolescent sleep, comparing the
  relative effects of retrospective self-report vs. time-use diary measures of
  technology use. By doing so, it provides an empirical lens to understand the
  effects of digital engagement both throughout the day and before bedtime and
  adds nuance to a research area primarily relying on retrospective self-report.
  RESULTS: The study finds that there is a small negative association relating
  digital engagement to adolescent sleep both on weekdays and weekend days
  (median standardized association βweekday = -0.06 and βweekend = -0.03). There
  is a more negative association between digital engagement and total sleep time
  on weekdays compared to weekend days (median standardized βweekday = -0.08,
  median standardized βweekend = -0.02), while there is no such difference when
  examining adolescents' bedtime. Surprisingly, and contrary to our
  expectations, digital technology use before bedtime is not substantively
  associated with the amount of sleep and the tardiness of bedtime in
  adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Results derived from the use of transparent
  Specification Curve Analysis methods show that the negative associations in
  evidence are mainly driven by retrospective technology use measures and
  measures of total time spent on digital devices during the day. The effects
  are overall very small: for example, an additional hour of digital screen time
  per day was only related to a 9 min decrease in total time spent sleeping on
  weekdays and a 3 min decrease on weekends. Using digital screens 30 min before
  bed led to a 1 min decrease in total time spent sleeping on weekdays and
  weekends. The study shows that more work should be done examining how to
  measure digital screen time before interventions are designed.},

  non-significant once corrected for publication bias. For interference cost,
  there was a very small but significant bilingual advantage (g =.11). Effects
  were not significantly moderated by task or participant age, but were
  moderated by an interaction between age of second language acquisition (AoA)

  abstract = {Background: Difficulty using the upper-limb is a major barrier to
  independence for many patients post-stroke or brain injury. High dose
  rehabilitation can result in clinically significant improvements in function
  even years after the incident; however, there is still high variability in
  patient responsiveness to such interventions that cannot be explained by age,
  sex, or time since stroke. Methods: This retrospective study investigated
  whether patients prescribed certain classes of central nervous system-acting
  drugs—γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists, antiepileptics, and
  antidepressants—differed in their outcomes on the three-week intensive Queen
  Square Upper-Limb program. For 277 stroke or brain injury patients (167 male,
  median age 52 years (IQR: 21), median time since incident 20 months (IQR: 26))
  upper-limb impairment and activity was assessed at admission to the program
  and at six months post-discharge, using the upper limb component of the
  Fugl-Meyer, Action Research Arm Test, and Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity
  Inventory. Drug prescriptions were obtained from primary care physicians at
  referral. Specification curve analysis was used to protect against selective
  reporting results and add robustness to the conclusions of this retrospective
  study. Results: Patients with GABA agonist prescriptions had significantly
  worse upper-limb scores at admission but no evidence for a significant
  difference in program-induced improvements was found. Additionally, no
  evidence of significant differences in patients with or without antiepileptic
  drug prescriptions on either admission to, or improvement on, the program was
  found in this study. Although no evidence was found for differences in
  admission scores, patients with antidepressant prescriptions experienced
  reduced improvement in upper-limb function, even when accounting for anxiety
  and depression scores. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that, when
  prescribed typically, there was no evidence that patients prescribed GABA
  agonists performed worse on this high-intensity rehabilitation program.
  Patients prescribed antidepressants, however, performed poorer than expected
  on the Queen Square Upper-Limb rehabilitation program. While the reasons for
  these differences are unclear, identifying these patients prior to admission
  may allow for better accommodation of differences in their rehabilitation

  methods for tracking the quality of people's sleep are laborious and
  obtrusive. If a method were available that would allow effortless and
  unobtrusive tracking of sleep quality, it would mark a significant step toward
  obtaining sleep data for research and clinical applications. Objective: Our
  goal was to evaluate the potential of mobile sensing data to obtain
  information about a person's sleep quality. For this purpose, we investigated
  to what extent various automatically gathered mobile sensing features are
  capable of predicting (1) subjective sleep quality (SSQ), (2) negative affect
  (NA), and (3) depression; these variables are associated with objective sleep
  quality. Through a multiverse analysis, we examined how the predictive quality
  varied as a function of the selected sensor, the extracted feature, various
  preprocessing options, and the statistical prediction model. Methods: We used
  data from a 2-week trial where we collected mobile sensing and experience
  sampling data from an initial sample of 60 participants. After data cleaning
  and removing participants with poor compliance, we retained 50 participants.
  Mobile sensing data involved the accelerometer, charging status, light sensor,
  physical activity, screen activity, and Wi-Fi status. Instructions were given
  to participants to keep their smartphone charged and connected to Wi-Fi at
  night. We constructed 1 model for every combination of multiverse parameters
  to evaluate their effects on each of the outcome variables. We evaluated the
  statistical models by applying them to training, validation, and test sets to
  prevent overfitting. Results: Most models (on either of the outcome variables)
  were not informative on the validation set (ie, predicted R2≤0). However, our
  best models achieved R2 values of 0.658, 0.779, and 0.074 for SSQ, NA, and
  depression, respectively on the training set and R2 values of 0.348, 0.103,
  and 0.025, respectively on the test set. Conclusions: The approach
  demonstrated in this paper has shown that different choices (eg, preprocessing
  choices, various statistical models, different features) lead to vastly
  different results that are bad and relatively good as well. Nevertheless,
  there were some promising results, particularly for SSQ, which warrant further

  order to have enough power to identify true effects. We provide examples of
  these power problems and suggest some solutions using Bayesian statistics and
  meta-analysis. Although the need for multiple replication studies may
  frustrate those who would prefer quick answers to psychology's alleged crisis,
  the large sample sizes typically needed to provide firm evidence will almost
  always require concerted efforts from multiple investigators. As a result, it

  evidence that fragile VSTM is different from visual working memory as magnetic
  stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) disrupts
  visual working memory, while leaving fragile VSTM intact. In addition, we
  observed that people with high DLPFC activity had superior working memory
  capacity compared to people with low DLPFC activity, and only people with high

  technique with prior-predictive tail probabilities to define replication

  success, called the sceptical p-value. The sceptical p-value integrates
  traditional significance of both the original and the replication study with a
  comparison of the respective effect sizes. It incorporates the uncertainty of
  both the original and the replication effect estimates and reduces to the
  ordinary p-value of the replication study if the uncertainty of the original
  effect estimate is ignored. The framework proposed can also be used to
  determine the power or the required replication sample size to achieve
  replication success. Numerical calculations highlight the difficulty of
  achieving replication success if the evidence from the original study is only
  suggestive. An application to data from the Open Science Collaboration project
  on the replicability of psychological science illustrates the methodology

  abstract = {Replication studies are increasingly conducted in order to confirm
  original findings. However, there is no established standard how to assess
  replication success and in practice many different approaches are used. The
  purpose of this paper is to refine and extend a recently proposed
  reverse-Bayes approach for the analysis of replication studies. We show how
  this method is directly related to the relative effect size, the ratio of the
  replication to the original effect estimate. This perspective leads to a new
  proposal to recalibrate the assessment of replication success, the golden
  level. The recalibration ensures that for borderline significant original
  studies replication success can only be achieved if the replication effect
  estimate is larger than the original one. Conditional power for replication
  success can then take any desired value if the original study is significant
  and the replication sample size is large enough. Compared to the standard
  approach to require statistical significance of both the original and
  replication study, replication success at the golden level offers uniform
  gains in project power and controls the Type-I error rate if the replication
  sample size is not smaller than the original one. An application to data from
  four large replication projects shows that the new approach leads to more
  appropriate inferences, as it penalizes shrinkage of the replication estimate
  compared to the original one, while ensuring that both effect estimates are
  sufficiently convincing on their own.},

  been the topic of considerable discussion in the last decade. Ideas, and
  corresponding phrases, have been introduced to help unpack researcher
  behaviors, including researcher degrees of freedom and questionable research

  researchers have considered how researchers' choices impact statistical

  few diagnostic tests are inherently dichotomous. The majority of tests are
  based on categorization of individuals according to one or several underlying
  continuous traits. For these tests, the magnitude of diagnostic
  misclassification depends not only on the magnitude of the measurement or
  perception error of the underlying trait(s), but also on the distribution of
  the underlying trait(s) in the population relative to the diagnostic cutpoint.
  Since this distribution also determines prevalence of the disease in the
  population, diagnostic misclassification and disease prevalence are related
  for this type of test. We assess the variation of various measures of validity
  of diagnostic tests with disease prevalence for simple models of the
  distribution of the underlying trait(s) and the measurement or perception
  error. We illustrate that variation with disease prevalence is typically
  strong for sensitivity and specificity, and even more so for the likelihood

  abstract = {Publication bias is a type of systematic error when synthesizing
  evidence that cannot represent the underlying truth. Clinical studies with
  favorable results are more likely published and thus exaggerate the
  synthesized evidence in meta-analyses. The trim-and-fill method is a popular
  tool to detect and adjust for publication bias. Simulation studies have been
  performed to assess this method, but they may not fully represent realistic
  settings about publication bias. Based on real-world meta-analyses, this
  article provides practical guidelines and recommendations for using the
  trim-and-fill method. We used a worked illustrative example to demonstrate the
  idea of the trim-and-fill method, and we reviewed three estimators (R0, L0,
  and Q0) for imputing missing studies. A resampling method was proposed to
  calculate P values for all 3 estimators. We also summarized available
  meta-analysis software programs for implementing the trim-and-fill method.
  Moreover, we applied the method to 29,932 meta-analyses from the Cochrane
  Database of Systematic Reviews, and empirically evaluated its overall
  performance. We carefully explored potential issues occurred in our analysis.
  The estimators L0 and Q0 detected at least one missing study in more
  meta-analyses than R0, while Q0 often imputed more missing studies than L0.
  After adding imputed missing studies, the significance of heterogeneity and
  overall effect sizes changed in many meta-analyses. All estimators generally
  converged fast. However, L0 and Q0 failed to converge in a few meta-analyses
  that contained studies with identical effect sizes. Also, P values produced by
  different estimators could yield different conclusions of publication bias
  significance. Outliers and the pre-specified direction of missing studies
  could have influential impact on the trim-and-fill results. Meta-analysts are
  recommended to perform the trim-and-fill method with great caution when using
  meta-analysis software programs. Some default settings (e.g., the choice of
  estimators and the direction of missing studies) in the programs may not be
  optimal for a certain meta-analysis; they should be determined on a
  case-by-case basis. Sensitivity analyses are encouraged to examine effects of
  different estimators and outlying studies. Also, the trim-and-fill estimator
  should be routinely reported in meta-analyses, because the results depend
  highly on it.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rank correlation test introduced by Begg and
  Mazumdar is extensively used in meta-analysis to test for publication bias in
  clinical and epidemiological studies. It is based on correlating the
  standardized treatment effect with the variance of the treatment effect using
  Kendall's tau as the measure of association. To our knowledge, the operational
  characteristics regarding the significance level of the test have not,
  however, been fully assessed. METHODS: We propose an alternative rank
  correlation test to improve the error rates of the original Begg and Mazumdar
  test. This test is based on the simulated distribution of the estimated
  measure of association, conditional on sampling variances. Furthermore,
  Spearman's rho is suggested as an alternative rank correlation coefficient.
  The attained level and power of the tests are studied by simulations of
  meta-analyses assuming the fixed effects model. RESULTS: The significance
  levels of the original Begg and Mazumdar test often deviate considerably from
  the nominal level, the null hypothesis being rejected too infrequently. It is
  proven mathematically that the assumptions for using the rank correlation test
  are not strictly satisfied. The pairs of variables fail to be independent, and
  there is a correlation between the standardized effect sizes and sampling
  variances under the null hypothesis of no publication bias. In the
  meta-analysis setting, the adverse consequences of a false negative test are
  more profound than the disadvantages of a false positive test. Our alternative
  test improves the error rates in fixed effects meta-analysis. Its significance
  level equals the nominal value, and the Type II error rate is reduced. In
  small data sets Spearman's rho should be preferred to Kendall's tau as the
  measure of association. CONCLUSIONS: As the attained significance levels of
  the test introduced by Begg and Mazumdar often deviate greatly from the
  nominal level, modified rank correlation tests, improving the error rates,
  should be preferred when testing for publication bias assuming fixed effects
  meta-analysis.},

  simple linear regression of the standardized estimate of treatment effect on
  the precision of the estimate; and a regression of the treatment effect on
  sample size. The tests are applied to simulated meta-analyses in the presence
  and absence of publication bias. Both one-sided and two-sided censoring of
  studies based on statistical significance was used. The results indicate that
  none of the tests performs consistently well. Test performance varied with the
  magnitude of the true treatment effect, distribution of study size and whether
  a one- or two-tailed significance test was employed. Overall, the power of the
  tests was low when the number of studies per meta-analysis was close to that
  often observed in practice. Tests that showed the highest power also had type
  I error rates higher than the nominal level. Based on the empirical type I
  error rates, a regression of treatment effect on sample size, weighted by the
  inverse of the variance of the logit of the pooled proportion (using the

  that fail to find a significant effect (or that demonstrate effects in an
  undesired or unexpected direction) are less likely to be published. This
  phenomenon, termed publication bias, can cause problems when researchers
  attempt to synthesize results using meta-analytic methods. Various techniques
  exist that attempt to estimate and correct meta-analyses for publication bias.
  However, there is no single method that can (a) account for continuous
  moderators by including them within the model, (b) allow for substantial data
  heterogeneity, (c) produce an adjusted mean effect size, (d) include a formal
  test for publication bias, and (e) allow for correction when only a small
  number of effects is included in the analysis. This article describes a method
  that we believe helps fill that gap. The model uses the beta density as a
  weight function that represents the selection process and provides adjusted
  parameter estimates that account for publication bias. Use of the beta density
  allows us to represent selection using fewer parameters than similar models so
  that the proposed model is suitable for meta-analyses that include relatively
  few studies. We explain the model and its rationale, illustrate its use with a
  real data set, and describe the results of a simulation study that shows the

  the idealistic model assumptions underlying selection methods and the
  sensitivity of population average effect size estimates to them, we advocate
  that selection methods should be used less for obtaining a single estimate

  statistically significant findings are overrepresented in the published
  literature, a phenomenon usually referred to as publication bias, which in
  turn can lead to biased conclusions. Various methods have been proposed in the
  meta-analytic literature for detecting the presence of publication bias,
  estimating its potential impact, and correcting for it. So-called selection
  models are among the most sophisticated methods for this purpose, as they
  attempt to directly model the selection process. If a particular selection
  model is an adequate approximation for the underlying selection process, then
  the model provides estimates of the parameters of interest (e.g., the average
  true effect and the amount of heterogeneity in the true effects) that are
  'corrected' for this selection process (i.e., they are estimates of the
  parameters in the population of studies before any selection has taken place).

  about other people? What about substances that are disgusting and bitter?
  Various studies have linked physical disgust to moral disgust, but despite the
  rich and sometimes striking findings these studies have yielded, no research
  has explored morality in conjunction with taste, which can vary greatly and
  may differentially affect cognition. The research reported here tested the
  effects of taste perception on moral judgments. After consuming a sweet
  beverage, a bitter beverage, or water, participants rated a variety of moral
  transgressions. Results showed that taste perception significantly affected
  moral judgments, such that physical disgust (induced via a bitter taste)
  elicited feelings of moral disgust. Further, this effect was more pronounced
  in participants with politically conservative views than in participants with
  politically liberal views. Taken together, these differential findings suggest
  that embodied gustatory experiences may affect moral processing more than
  previously thought.},

  research psychologists about the meaning and role of replication in

  all participants (98\% of Australians and 96\% of Italians) selected options
  that correspond to a direct replication. Only 14\% of Australians and 8\% of
  Italians selected any options that included changing the experimental method.
  Majorities of psychologists from both countries agreed that replications are
  very important, that more replications should be done, that more resources
  should be allocated to them, and that they should be published more often.
  Majorities of psychologists from both countries reported that they or their
  students sometimes or often replicate studies, yet they also reported having
  no replication studies published in the prior 5 years. When asked to estimate
  the percentage of published studies in psychology that are replications, both
  Australians (with a median estimate of 13\%) and Italians (with a median
  estimate of 20\%) substantially overestimated the actual rate. When asked what
  constitute the main obstacles to replications, difficulty publishing
  replications was the most frequently cited obstacle, coupled with the high

  scores of 198 individuals diagnosed with intellectual disability. Confirmatory

  RESULTS: The intelligence structure in intellectual disability resembled the
  one previously reported for typical development, suggesting configural but not
  metric invariance. When Z or age-equivalent scores (but not traditional scaled
  scores) were used, the average profile resembled the one previously reported
  for other neurodevelopmental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods avoided any
  floor effects, generating similar but not identical profiles. Despite some
  practical and conceptual limitations, age-equivalent scores may be easier to
  interpret. This was true even for a subgroup of individuals with more severe
  disabilities (mean IQ < 43).},

  Unlike standard procedures that require equating the score function of the

  the score is instead used as an external informative constraint to the
  maximization of the convex Shannon's entropy function. The problem involves
  the reparameterization of the score parameters as expected values of discrete
  probability distributions where probabilities need to be estimated. This leads
  to a simpler situation where parameters are searched in smaller (hyper)
  simplex space. We assessed our proposal by means of empirical case studies and
  a simulation study, the latter involving the most critical case of logistic
  regression under data separation. The results suggested that the maximum
  entropy reformulation of the score problem solves the likelihood equation
  problem. Similarly, when maximum likelihood estimation is difficult, as is the
  case of logistic regression under separation, the maximum entropy proposal
  achieved results (numerically) comparable to those obtained by the Firth's
  bias-corrected approach. Overall, these first findings reveal that a maximum
  entropy solution can be considered as an alternative technique to solve the

  deals with data scattered over regions having complicated shapes, featuring
  complex boundaries, sharp concavities or holes. Moreover, it captures very
  well complicated signals having multiple modes with different directions and

  females' mathematical ability and this stereotype can be activated by an
  experimental manipulation that reminds females of the stereotype. Yet,
  evidence of a stereotype threat effect on mathematics performance in childhood

  study of stereotype threat among Italian adolescents with a much larger sample

  grade (84 male, 80 female, mean age = 16.2) public high school students.
  Performance in tests administered both before and after the experimental
  manipulations were analyzed with a series of logistic mixed-effects models.
  Model comparisons confirmed that males performed better than females, but the

  variation; temporal interval was 180-300 ms poststimulus) in terms of peak
  amplitude and latency variables. The results indicated 4 important findings.
  First, there was an emotional-specific ERP deflection only for emotional
  stimuli, not for neutral stimuli. Second, the unaware information processing
  was quite similar to that of aware in terms of peak morphology, but not in
  terms of latency. In fact, unconscious stimulation produced a more delayed
  peak variation than did conscious stimulation. Third, valence of facial
  stimulus (positive or negative) was supraliminally and subliminally decoded
  because it was showed by differences of peak deflection between negative high
  arousing (fear and anger) and low arousing (happiness, sadness, and neutral)
  stimuli. Finally, the author found a more posterior distribution of ERP as a
  function of emotional content of the stimulus. Cortical lateralization (right

  girls; Mage = 282.9 days, SD = 8.10) was provided to 7 distinct teams for
  analysis. The data were obtained from infants watching video sequences showing
  a hand, initially resting between two toys, grabbing one of them (after
  Woodward, 1998). After habituation, infants were shown (in random order) a
  sequence of four test events that varied target position and target toy.

  linearand nonlinear mixed-effects models in the analysis of grouped data,such
  as longitudinal data, repeated measures, and multilevel data. A unified
  model-building strategy for both linear and nonlinear models is presented and
  applied to the analysis of over 20 real datasets froma wide variety of areas,
  including pharmacokinetics, agriculture, and manufacturing. A strong emphasis
  is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various phases of the
  model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the data and
  concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a fitted model.
  Over 170 figures are included in the book. The NLME library for analyzing
  mixed-effects models in S and S-PLUS, developed by the authors, provides the
  underlying software for implementing the methods presented in the text, being
  described and illustrated in detail throughout the book. The balanced mix of
  real data examples, modeling software, and theory makes this book a useful
  reference for practitioners using mixed-effects models in their data analyses.
  It can also be used as a text for a one-semester graduate-level applied course
  in mixed-effects models. Researchers in statistical computing will also find

  For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher
  power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the
  data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to
  account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For
  non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of
  interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The
  logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these
  issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages,
  comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed,
  arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or

  Although pupil diameter is increasingly recognized as an alternative measure

  analyse this variable converge. To this end, we proposed a crowdsourced

  girls; Mage = 282.9 days, SD = 8.10) was provided to 7 distinct teams for
  analysis. The data were obtained from infants watching video sequences showing
  a hand, initially resting between two toys, grabbing one of them (after
  Woodward, 1998). After habituation, infants were shown (in random order) a
  sequence of four test events that varied target position and target toy.

  participants could freely use their facial mimicry whereas in the other half,

  average, both P1 and N170 ERP components were not sensitive to mimicry
  manipulation. However, when taking into account alexithymic traits, a scenario
  corroborating sensorimotor simulation models emerged, with two dissociable
  temporal windows affected by mimicry manipulation as a function of alexithymia
  levels. Specifically, as a function of mimicry manipulation, individuals with
  lower alexithymic traits showed modulations of the P1 amplitude, while
  individuals with higher alexithymic traits showed modulations of the later

  increased connectivity between sensorimotor and extrastriate visual regions in

  incorporates error in estimating the standard deviations of the tasks from

  congenital facial weakness (uni- or bilateral) and impairment of ocular
  abduction (uni- or bilateral). Three boys (one of them mentally retarded) out
  of 22 participants (12 males and 10 females) were found suspicious of ASD by

  mimicry depends on the social context: we only mimic emotional signals that

  As a further consequence, we are less likely to mimic strangers and we do not

  identification). Relatedly, alternative conscious perception accounts (as well

  \& Merikle, 1988, 1990) predict positive relationships between direct and
  indirect measures. Contrariwise, our review suggests that negative and/or

  unconscious perception and further suggesting that conscious and unconscious
  perceptual influences are functionally exclusive (cf. Jones, 1987), in such a

  no method to do correct inference for overdispersed data. We use Bayesian

  methods our software implementation-psignifit 4-performs numerical integration

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimating the required sample size and statistical
  power for a study is an integral part of study design. For standard designs,
  power equations provide an efficient solution to the problem, but they are
  unavailable for many complex study designs that arise in practice. For such
  complex study designs, computer simulation is a useful alternative for
  estimating study power. Although this approach is well known among
  statisticians, in our experience many epidemiologists and social scientists
  are unfamiliar with the technique. This article aims to address this knowledge
  gap. METHODS: We review an approach to estimate study power for individual- or
  cluster-randomized designs using computer simulation. This flexible approach
  arises naturally from the model used to derive conventional power equations,
  but extends those methods to accommodate arbitrarily complex designs. The
  method is universally applicable to a broad range of designs and outcomes, and
  we present the material in a way that is approachable for quantitative,
  applied researchers. We illustrate the method using two examples (one simple,
  one complex) based on sanitation and nutritional interventions to improve
  child growth. RESULTS: We first show how simulation reproduces conventional
  power estimates for simple randomized designs over a broad range of sample
  scenarios to familiarize the reader with the approach. We then demonstrate how
  to extend the simulation approach to more complex designs. Finally, we discuss
  extensions to the examples in the article, and provide computer code to
  efficiently run the example simulations in both R and Stata. CONCLUSIONS:
  Simulation methods offer a flexible option to estimate statistical power for
  standard and non-traditional study designs and parameters of interest. The
  approach we have described is universally applicable for evaluating study
  designs used in epidemiologic and social science research.},

  result of this chapter is simply a simulated data set to play with in Chapter
  5. We walk through the generation of a classical point count data set in great
  detail, and then show how the R code can be packaged into a function that
  allows for convenient modification of important settings of the simulation,
  such as population size, sample size, detection probability, or strength of
  covariate relationships, using function arguments. The main reason for
  allocating an entire chapter to data simulation is to highlight its power and
  importance. The benefits of data simulation are huge and include the
  following: (1) the truth is known; hence we have some insurance against making
  coding errors in BUGS by ensuring that estimated parameters match
  data-generation parameters, (2) we can calibrate derived model parameters in
  simulations, (3) we can experience sampling error, which is a fundamental
  concept in statistics that is very elusive for most ecologists, (4) it
  provides a check of the frequentist quality of estimators (e.g., bias or
  precision), for selected features of a study (e.g., sample sizes), and of
  other specifics of the data (e.g., parameter values), (5) data simulation is
  the most flexible and straightforward way of conducting power analyses, (6) we
  can investigate the identifiability of parameters, especially for complex
  models, (7) we can gauge the robustness of a model to assumption violations,
  and finally (8) being able to simulate data under a model essentially
  guarantees that one understands the model. The data set we simulate mimics the
  way in which we imagine that spatially and temporally replicated counts arise
  in ecology as a combination of an ecological process and an observation
  process. The former contains the mechanisms that underlie spatiotemporal
  patterns in abundance, while the latter embodies the various facets of
  measurement errors. For the simple case of spatial variation of abundance and
  false-negative detection or measurement error, this simulation represents the
  canonical example of count data dealt with throughout this book.},

  variants from a cross-product of analytic decisions, and the results require
  nuanced interpretation. We contribute Baba: an integrated domain-specific
  language (DSL) and visual analysis system for authoring and reviewing
  multiverse analyses. With the Boba DSL, analysts write the shared portion of
  analysis code only once, alongside local variations defining alternative
  decisions, from which the compiler generates a multiplex of scripts
  representing all possible analysis paths. The Boba Visualizer provides linked
  views of model results and the multiverse decision space to enable rapid,
  systematic assessment of consequential decisions and robustness, including
  sampling uncertainty and model fit. We demonstrate Boba's utility through two
  data analysis case studies, and reflect on challenges and design opportunities
  for multiverse analysis software.},

  Previous research has shown that visual perception of body stimuli recruits
  visual cortices together with observer's body representation in somatosensory
  cortex, which is known for processing body-related information (e.g., haptics,
  kinematics). However, whether attentional selection of visual body stimuli
  involves just visual or additional somatosensory areas remains elusive. Here
  we elicited visual and somatosensory evoked activity during a visual search
  task, whereby participants searched for target hand images defined by either
  visual (colour) or bodily (posture) features. In line with previous studies,
  we found electrophysiological evidence for attentional selection over visual
  areas (i.e., N2pc) regardless of the feature type. Importantly, after
  dissociating somatosensory from visual evoked activity, we show that only
  attentional selection of hand posture - but not hand colour - elicits
  modulation of somatosensory evoked electrocortical activity over somatosensory
  cortex. This suggests that attention may not only modulate cortical activity
  associated with the input-sensory modality (in this case, visual), but,
  depending on the type of attended information, it may also modulate cortical
  activity associated with another task-relevant sensory modality (in this case,
  somatosensory). Overall, our results provide evidence for a flexible attention

  element difference could occur (T = 1) while set size was varied. In
  Experiments 4-6, set size was fixed while the number of stimuli that might
  change was varied (T = 1, 2, 3, and 4). Three general models were tested

  Mathematical modeling allows to interpret the conscious to subliminal

  by nonprogressive congenital uni- or bi-lateral facial (i. e. VII cranial
  nerve) and abducens (i. e. VI cranial nerve) palsy. Although the neurological
  and ophthalmological findings are quite well-known, data concerning the
  attendant functional difficulties and their changes over time are seldom
  addressed. In this study we attempt to estimate the prevalence of clinical and
  functional data in an Italian cohort affected by MBS. METHODS: The study
  included 50 children, 21 males and 29 females, aged 1 month to 14 years. The
  patients entered into a multidisciplinary diagnostic and follow-up protocol
  that had the specific purpose of detecting clinical and developmental deficits
  related to MBS. RESULTS: Involvement of the VII cranial nerve (total/partial,
  bilateral or unilateral) was present in 96 \% of patients, and of the VI nerve
  in 85 \%. Two patients were without impairment of the VII nerve and seven
  patients had no involvement of the VI nerve and were thus classified as
  Moebius-like because of the involvement of other CNs. Additional affected CNs
  were numbers III-IV in 16 \%, V in 11 \%, VIII and X each in 8 \%, the XI in 6
  \%, the IX, most often partially, in 22 \%, and the XII in 48 \% of cases.
  Their development was characterized by global delay at one year of age, motor,
  emotional and speech difficulties at two years of age, a trend toward
  normalization at three years of age but with weakness in hand-eye
  coordination, and achieving average results at five years of age. Overall 90
  \% of children had a normal developmental quotient whereas only 10 \%
  manifested cognitive deficits. CONCLUSION: Early rehabilitation may enhance
  the recovery of normal function, particularly in vulnerable areas of
  development. It is possible that early intervention that integrates sensory
  and visual information with emotional difficulties can improve the prognosis
  of the child with MBS.},

  sub-threshold level-facial expressions of other individuals. Numerous studies
  support a role of facial mimicry in recognizing others' emotions. However, the
  underlying functional mechanism is unclear. A prominent hypothesis considers
  facial mimicry as based on an action-perception loop, leading to the
  prediction that facial mimicry should be observed only when processing others'
  facial expressions. Nevertheless, previous studies have also detected facial
  mimicry during observation of emotional bodily expressions. An emergent
  alternative hypothesis is that facial mimicry overtly reflects the simulation
  of an "emotion", rather than the reproduction of a specific observed motor
  pattern. In the present study, we tested whether blocking mimicry ("Bite") on
  the lower face disrupted recognition of happy expressions conveyed by either
  facial or body expressions. In Experiment 1, we tested participants' ability
  to identify happy, fearful and neutral expressions in the Bite condition and
  in two control conditions. In Experiment 2, to ensure that such a manipulation
  selectively affects emotion recognition, we tested participants' ability to
  recognize emotional expressions, as well as the actors' gender, under the Bite
  condition and a control condition. Finally, we investigated the relationship
  between dispositional empathy and emotion recognition under the condition of
  blocked mimicry. Our findings demonstrated that blocking mimicry on the lower
  face hindered recognition of happy facial and body expressions, while the
  recognition of neutral and fearful expressions was not affected by the mimicry
  manipulation. The mimicry manipulation did not affect the gender
  discrimination task. Furthermore, the impairment of happy expression
  recognition correlated with empathic traits. These results support the role of
  facial mimicry in emotion recognition and suggest that facial mimicry reflects
  a global sensorimotor simulation of others' emotions rather than a
  muscle-specific reproduction of an observed motor expression.},

  traditional measures of this ORE provide a binary measure of discrimination or

  quality of face representations. We applied a novel continuous-response
  paradigm to independently measure the number of own-race and other-race face
  representations stored in visual working memory (VWM) and the precision with
  which they are stored. Participants reported target own-race or other-race
  faces on a circular face space that smoothly varied along the dimension of
  identity. Using probabilistic mixture modeling, we found that following ample
  encoding time, the ORE is attributable to differences in the probability of a
  face being maintained in VWM. Reducing encoding time, a manipulation that is
  more sensitive to encoding limitations, caused a loss of precision or an
  increase in variability of VWM for other-race but not own-race faces. These
  results suggest that the ORE is driven by the inefficiency with which
  other-race faces are rapidly encoded in VWM and provide novel insights about
  how perceptual experience influences the representation of own-race and

  studies were rated for quality, risk of bias and publication bias. Results:
  The following effect sizes (g) were observed: emotion management: 0.96 [0.77,
  1.14] and cognitive reappraisal: 0.49 [0.32, 0.66] were negatively associated
  with schizophrenia. Experiential avoidance: - 0.44 [- 0.59, - 0.29],
  attentional deployment - 0.96 [- 1.18, - 0.75], dissociation: - 0.86 [- 1.13,
  - 0.60] and alexithymia: - 1.05 [- 1.45, - 0.65] were positively associated
  with schizophrenia. Subgroups of dissociation and attentional deployment were
  also analysed. Meta-analyses revealed potential publication bias and
  heterogeneity in the study of CERS in schizophrenia. Conclusions: A marked
  difference in the implementation of CERS is associated with schizophrenia
  compared to controls. Dissociation variables and alexithymia are also
  indicated and may be implicated in adaptive cognitive emotional regulation.

  abstract = {One aspect of consciousness phenomena, the temporal emergence of
  visual awareness, has been subject of a controversial debate. How can visual
  awareness, that is the experiential quality of visual stimuli, be
  characterized best? Is there a sharp discontinuous or dichotomous transition
  between unaware and fully aware states, or does awareness emerge gradually
  encompassing intermediate states? Previous studies yielded conflicting results
  and supported both dichotomous and gradual views. It is well conceivable that
  these conflicting results are more than noise, but reflect the dynamic nature
  of the temporal emergence of visual awareness. Using a psychophysical
  approach, the present research tested whether the emergence of visual
  awareness is context-dependent with a temporal two-alternative forced choice
  task. During backward masking of word targets, it was assessed whether the
  relative temporal sequence of stimulus thresholds is modulated by the task
  (stimulus presence, letter case, lexical decision, and semantic category) and
  by mask type. Four masks with different similarity to the target features were
  created. Psychophysical functions were then fitted to the accuracy data in the
  different task conditions as a function of the stimulus mask SOA in order to
  determine the inflection point (conscious threshold of each feature) and slope
  of the psychophysical function (transition from unaware to aware within each
  feature). Depending on feature-mask similarity, thresholds in the different
  tasks were highly dispersed suggesting a graded transition from unawareness to
  awareness or had less differentiated thresholds indicating that clusters of
  features probed by the tasks quite simultaneously contribute to the percept.
  The latter observation, although not compatible with the notion of a sharp
  all-or-none transition between unaware and aware states, suggests a less
  gradual or more discontinuous emergence of awareness. Analyses of slopes of
  the fitted psychophysical functions also indicated that the emergence of
  awareness of single features is variable and might be influenced by the
  continuity of the feature dimensions. The present work thus suggests that the
  emergence of awareness is neither purely gradual nor dichotomous, but highly
  dynamic depending on the task and mask type.},

  abstract = {The empirical examination of the capacities and capabilities of
  the cognitive unconscious creates an ongoing debate, partly because each new
  piece of evidence may carry far-reaching implications for our understanding of
  consciousness, or, more generally, for our views on what is it like to be
  human. Adding to this discourse, the current chapter tackles the question by
  empirically and conceptually examining working memory (WM) and controlled
  processes, which--unlike their longtime companions, the automatic
  processes--are exclusively associated with conscious processing. Automatic
  cognitive processes are internal automatons that help us navigate a
  multifaceted and complex environment by slicing it into easily digestible
  bites. They may be unintentional, nonconscious, ballistic, and effortless, and
  can thus free our very-limited-capacity consciousness from many burdens.
  Controlled processes are usually thought of as the counterpart of automatic
  processes. They are intentional, conscious, and effortful, and hence allow
  more comprehensive information processing, one that exploits the richness and
  flexibility of consciousness and thus avoids the pitfalls of the narrow,
  one-track-minded automatons. In light of this prevalent view of automaticity
  and control, it is hardly surprising that the notion of nonconscious
  control--which appears in the title of this chapter--is widely held to be an
  oxymoron. On the most immediate level, this widespread belief appears to rest
  on pure logical grounds--how can (controlled) processes be conscious and
  nonconscious at the same time? But a closer look reveals that the notion of
  nonconscious controlled processes in higher cognition is disturbing for
  another deep reason: It suggests that mental processes, which are central to
  our conception of what it is to be human, occur outside of conscious awareness
  and have no phenomenology. Worries of this kind have led to a general
  disregard of the prospects of nonconscious controlled processes. This attitude
  continues to characterize the fields of cognitive psychology and social
  cognition despite the fact that research has started to yield evidence for
  nonconscious cognitive control in the area of automatic evaluation and
  stereotype use. The main purpose of this chapter is to advance the argument
  for nonconscious control and nonconscious controlled processes, and it does so
  in three ways: First, it presents systematic data which show that WM--the
  mental mechanism that is perhaps most associated with controlled, conscious
  processing--can operate outside of conscious awareness. Second, it reviews
  recent findings in social cognition and shows how they suggest that
  motivational aspects of WM can flexibly control behavior outside of conscious
  awareness. Last, it presents a conceptual analysis that starts by pointing out
  that the notion of control is used in more than one sense. Importantly, once
  the meanings of control are un-confounded, the relations of conscious
  awareness and cognitive control become a matter of empirical inquiry. Hence, I
  argue, the notion of nonconscious control is not an oxymoron and, indeed, it
  cannot be one--by definition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all

  propagation in a population of loosely coupled signaling elements. In
  computational applications, GW architectures recruit many distributed,
  specialized agents to cooperate in resolving focal ambiguities. In the brain,
  conscious experiences may reflect a GW function. For animals, the natural
  world is full of unpredictable dangers and opportunities, suggesting a general
  adaptive pressure for brains to resolve focal ambiguities quickly and
  accurately. GW theory aims to understand the differences between conscious and
  unconscious brain events. In humans and related species the cortico-thalamic
  (C-T) core is believed to underlie conscious aspects of perception, thinking,
  learning, feelings of knowing (FOK), felt emotions, visual imagery, working
  memory, and executive control. Alternative theoretical perspectives are also
  discussed. The C-T core has many anatomical hubs, but conscious percepts are
  unitary and internally consistent at any given moment. Over time, conscious
  contents constitute a very large, open set. This suggests that a brain-based
  GW capacity cannot be localized in a single anatomical hub. Rather, it should
  be sought in a functional hub - a dynamic capacity for binding and propagation
  of neural signals over multiple task-related networks, a kind of neuronal
  cloud computing. In this view, conscious contents can arise in any region of
  the C-T core when multiple input streams settle on a winner-take-all
  equilibrium. The resulting conscious gestalt may ignite an any-to-many
  broadcast, lasting ∼100-200 ms, and trigger widespread adaptation in
  previously established networks. To account for the great range of conscious
  contents over time, the theory suggests an open repertoire of binding
  coalitions that can broadcast via theta/gamma or alpha/gamma phase coupling,
  like radio channels competing for a narrow frequency band. Conscious moments
  are thought to hold only 1-4 unrelated items; this small focal capacity may be
  the biological price to pay for global access. Visuotopic maps in cortex
  specialize in features like color, retinal size, motion, object identity, and
  egocentric/allocentric framing, so that a binding coalition for the sight of a
  rolling billiard ball in nearby space may resonate among activity maps of LGN,
  V1-V4, MT, IT, as well as the dorsal stream. Spatiotopic activity maps can
  bind into coherent gestalts using adaptive resonance (reentry). Single neurons
  can join a dominant coalition by phase tuning to regional oscillations in the
  4-12 Hz range. Sensory percepts may bind and broadcast from posterior cortex,
  while non-sensory FOKs may involve prefrontal and frontotemporal areas. The
  anatomy and physiology of the hippocampal complex suggest a GW architecture as
  well. In the intact brain the hippocampal complex may support conscious event
  organization as well as episodic memory storage.},

  that provides one answer to the question of how perceptual and conceptual
  processes are related. CSTM is a mental buffer and processor in which current
  perceptual stimuli and their associated concepts from long term memory (LTM)
  are represented briefly, allowing meaningful patterns or structures to be
  identified (Potter, 1993, 1999, 2009). CSTM is different from and
  complementary to other proposed forms of working memory: it is engaged
  extremely rapidly, has a large but ill-defined capacity, is largely
  unconscious, and is the basis for the unreflective understanding that is
  characteristic of everyday experience. The key idea behind CSTM is that most
  cognitive processing occurs without review or rehearsal of material in
  standard working memory and with little or no conscious reasoning. When one
  perceives a meaningful stimulus such as a word, picture, or object, it is
  rapidly identified at a conceptual level and in turn activates associated
  information from LTM. New links among concurrently active concepts are formed
  in CSTM, shaped by parsing mechanisms of language or grouping principles in
  scene perception and by higher-level knowledge and current goals. The
  resulting structure represents the gist of a picture or the meaning of a
  sentence, and it is this structure that we are conscious of and that can be
  maintained in standard working memory and consolidated into LTM. Momentarily
  activated information that is not incorporated into such structures either
  never becomes conscious or is rapidly forgotten. This whole cycle -
  identification of perceptual stimuli, memory recruitment, structuring,
  consolidation in LTM, and forgetting of non-structured material - may occur in
  less than 1 s when viewing a pictured scene or reading a sentence. The
  evidence for such a process is reviewed and its implications for the relation
  of perception and cognition are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016

  during creative problem solving. The experience of a sudden unexpected
  solution of the problem makes it distinct from other problem solving. Though
  the insight problem solving process is hidden from the observer and the solver
  himself, it is possible to study working memory changes during the
  problem-solving process in order to observe the tracks of insight. Objective:
  A critical experiment was carried out to determine whether it is legitimate to
  measure insight-problem-solving dynamics within a dual-task paradigm and
  working memory model. Also a verification was conducted of the hypothesis of
  whether insight problem solving competes for cognitive resources with
  unconscious processes. Design: We designed a special procedure based on
  Kahneman's (1973) modified dual-task paradigm, allowing simultaneous
  performance of the problem-solving process and probe tasks of different types.
  The reaction time was measured for the probe task. There were two problems
  conditions (insight and regular), and two probe tasks conditions (implicit and
  explicit). Participants: 32 participants, aged from 18 to 32 years (M = 19.81;
  sigma = 2.51). Results: Significant differences in implicit probe reaction
  time were found between the dual-task condition (implicit categorization and
  insight problem solving) and solo implicit probe condition (t(15) = -3.21, p =
  .006, d = -.76). A joint effect of problem type and probe type was found (F(1,
  60)= 4.85, p = .035, etap2 = .07). Conclusion: The results support the idea
  that information processing of conscious and of unconscious processes are
  separate. Unconscious processing capacity is limited. Implicit skill seems to
  be operated by the same mechanisms as insight problem solving, therefore
  competing for a common resource. It was also shown that such hidden creative
  unconscious processes as insight can be tracked via working memory load.

  recruit unconscious resources to carry out their jobs. Some suggest that
  consciousness requires WM, yet it is more likely that WM functions emerged
  from consciousness. There are striking similarities between WM and GW theory,

  abstract = {Blindsight and vision for action seem to be exemplars of
  unconscious visual processes. However, researchers have recently argued that
  blindsight is not really a kind of unconscious vision but is rather severely
  degraded conscious vision. Morten Overgaard and colleagues have recently
  developed new methods for measuring the visibility of visual stimuli. Studies
  using these methods show that reported clarity of visual stimuli correlates
  with accuracy in both normal individuals and blindsight patients. Vision for
  action has also come under scrutiny. Recent findings seem to show that
  information processed by the dorsal stream for online action contributes to
  visual awareness. Some interpret these results as showing that some dorsal
  stream processes are conscious visual processes (e.g., Gallese, 2007; Jacob \&
  Jeannerod, 2003). The aim of this paper is to provide new support for the more
  traditional view that blindsight and vision for action are genuinely
  unconscious perceptual processes. I argue that individuals with blindsight do
  not have access to the kind of purely qualitative color and size information
  which normal individuals do. So, even though people with blindsight have a
  kind of cognitive consciousness, visual information processing in blindsight
  patients is not associated with a distinctly visual phenomenology. I argue
  further that while dorsal stream processing seems to contribute to visual
  awareness, only information processed by the early dorsal stream (V1, V2, and
  V3) is broadcast to working memory. Information processed by later parts of
  the dorsal stream (the parietal lobe) never reaches working memory and hence
  does not correlate with phenomenal awareness. I conclude that both blindsight
  and vision for action are genuinely unconscious visual processes. (PsycINFO

  Originally proposed as mediating spatial perception ('Where'), more recent
  accounts suggest it primarily serves non-conscious visually guided action
  ('How'). Here, we identify three pathways emerging from the dorsal stream that
  consist of projections to the prefrontal and premotor cortices, and a major
  projection to the medial temporal lobe that courses both directly and
  indirectly through the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. These
  three pathways support both conscious and non-conscious visuospatial

  between conscious and non-conscious representations, on the one hand, and

  opened the way for human consciousness to return to the heights it held before
  the behavioristic coup of 1913. This is illustrated by seven cases: (1) the
  discovery of widespread brain activation during conscious perception; (2) high
  levels of regional brain metabolism in the resting state of consciousness,
  dropping drastically in unconscious states; (3) the brain correlates of-inner
  speech; (4) visual imagery; (5) fringe consciousness; (6) executive functions
  of the self; and (7) volition. Other papers in this issue expand on many of
  these points. (Roepstorff; Leopold Logothetis; Boerentsen; Haggard; Hohwy \&
  Frith). In the past, evidence based on subjective reports was often neglected
  (e.g., Ericsson, this issue). It is still true that brain evidence has greater
  credibility than subjective reports, no matter how reliable. What is new is
  increasing convergence between subjective experiences and brain observations.
  For that reason it is no longer rare to see the word `consciousness' and
  `subjectivity' in major science journals. No one so far has discovered a gulf
  dividing mind and brain. On the contrary, the new evidence supports the
  central role of consciousness as it was regarded over more than two millenia
  of written thought. In a sense this was predictable. Nature is full of
  unexpected convergences between fruit fly genes and the human body, between
  the arc of a tennis ball and the orbit of Mars, and between consciousness and
  the brain. These convergences show once again the remarkable unity of the
  observable universe.}

  abstract = {In this article, I argue that consciousness is a unique way of
  processing information, in that: it produces information, rather than purely
  transmitting it; the information it produces is meaningful for us; the meaning
  it has is always individuated. This uniqueness allows us to process
  information on the basis of our personal needs and ever-changing interactions
  with the environment, and consequently to act autonomously. Three main basic
  cognitive processes contribute to realize this unique way of information
  processing: the self, attention and working memory. The self, which is
  primarily expressed via the central and peripheral nervous systems, maps our
  body, the environment, and our relations with the environment. It is the
  primary means by which the complexity inherent to our composite structure is
  reduced into the ``single voice{''} of a unique individual. It provides a
  reference system that (albeit evolving) is sufficiently stable to define the
  variations that will be used as the raw material for the construction of
  conscious information. Attention allows for the selection of those variations
  in the state of the self that are most relevant in the given situation.
  Attention originates and is deployed from a single locus inside our body,
  which represents the center of the self, around which all our conscious
  experiences are organized. Whatever is focused by attention appears in our
  consciousness as possessing a spatial quality defined by this center and the
  direction toward which attention is focused. In addition, attention determines
  two other features of conscious experience: periodicity and phenomenal
  quality. Self and attention are necessary but not sufficient for conscious
  information to be produced. Complex forms of conscious experiences, such as
  the various modes of givenness of conscious experience and the stream of
  consciousness, need a working memory mechanism to assemble the basic pieces of
  information selected by attention.},

  sampling to estimate a single level of \%Yes or \%Correct, the current methods
  sample psychometric functions more broadly, to concurrently estimate

  independent of decision confounds. Developed for four tasks-(1) simple YN

  processes, is frequently assumed to be univocally associated with conscious
  processing. However, some monitoring processes, such as those associated with
  the evaluation of one's own performance, may conceivably be sufficiently
  automatized to be deployed non-consciously. Here, we used simultaneous
  electro- and magneto-encephalography (EEG/MEG) to investigate how error
  detection is modulated by perceptual awareness of a masked target digit. The
  Error-Related Negativity (ERN), an EEG component occurring ~100 ms after an
  erroneous response, was exclusively observed on conscious trials: regardless
  of masking strength, the amplitude of the ERN showed a step-like increase when
  the stimulus became visible. Nevertheless, even in the absence of an ERN,
  participants still managed to detect their errors at above-chance levels under
  subliminal conditions. Error detection on conscious trials originated from the
  posterior cingulate cortex, while a small response to non-conscious errors was
  seen in dorsal anterior cingulate. We propose the existence of two distinct
  brain mechanisms for metacognitive judgements: a conscious all-or-none process
  of single-trial response evaluation, and a non-conscious statistical

  leading to interference between representations and limiting the memory

  (i) Blindsight patients use an unusually conservative criterion to detect
  targets. (ii) In discrimination tasks, their confidence ratings are low and
  (iii) such confidence ratings poorly predict task accuracy on a trial-by-trial
  basis. (iv) Their detection capacity (d') is lower than expected based on

  represent and update the statistical information regarding the internal visual
  neural response, i.e. a failure in metacognition. We provide computational
  simulation data to demonstrate that this model can qualitatively account for
  the detection theoretic features of blindsight. Because such metacognitive
  mechanisms are likely to depend on the prefrontal cortex, this suggests that
  although blindsight is typically due to damage to the primary visual cortex,
  distal influence to the prefrontal cortex by such damage may be critical.

  the task; (b) visual awareness for low-visibility trials was elevated when
  mixed with high-visibility trials compared with when presented alone as
  demonstrated in both objective awareness (forced-choice performance) and

  effect priming of awareness: Visual priming fundamentally alters awareness,
  boosting otherwise invisible objects into consciousness. These results
  implicate two key requirements for measuring awareness: (a) verify that
  participants are truly performing the awareness task and (b) use all types of
  trials in the awareness test as in the main experiment. Priming of awareness

  studied asymptotic efficiency for the case of an independence working
  specification in relation to a correctly specified exchangeable association
  structure. We extended to ordinal measurements the results derived for binary
  outcomes, sustaining that the loss of efficiency depends both on the intensity
  of the association between responses and the design matrix. For equal cluster
  sizes, we showed that relative efficiency is high when responses are
  independent, when covariates are mean-balanced, or when all covariates are
  constant within clusters. However, relative efficiency noticeably declines
  with increasing association for non-mean-balanced within-cluster covariates.
  Simulation studies also supported these conclusions for data with an

  methodological research on meta-analysis. One methodological advancement that
  has gained significant traction is a Bayesian approach to meta-analysis.
  METHODS: We present a non-technical introduction to Bayesian meta-analysis.
  This introduction re-analyzes data from a meta-analysis concerning the impact
  of media literacy interventions on attitudes and intentions related to risky
  health behaviors using a Bayesian approach. One data relate media literacy
  interventions to media literacy skills, and another relates media literacy
  interventions to attitudes and behavioral intentions towards risky health
  behaviors. In these examples we focus on how to conduct unconditional models
  via graphical and quantitative results. Further, we demonstrate how to conduct
  subgroup analyses using risk behavior type (drinking, sexual, or smoking).
  RESULTS: We demonstrated how several meta-analytical quantities could be
  computed and interpreted in a Bayesian framework. This was done both
  graphically (plot of the marginal posterior distributions) and quantitatively
  (e.g., central tendency measures, highest posterior density intervals).
  Results also showed how analyzing effect sizes at the risk-behavior level
  could affect several interpretations. CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize that in no way
  are Bayesian methods "superior" to frequentist methods, nor that frequentist
  methods should be abandoned. Instead, the two approaches should be viewed as
  familial, each with advantages and disadvantages, but strive at a common
  purpose. We hope for increased use of Bayesian meta-analyses, and Bayesian
  methodology at large, in adolescence research. Last, all R code is provided
  for readers to use as a foundation for their own research.},

  ratio of the standard deviation of the random effects to the effect of

  heterogeneity in a meta-analysis relative to the effect being measured.
  However, very large CV values can occur when the effect is small making

  values to prospective goods and act to maximize their obtained value.
  Neuroeconomics strives to observe these values directly in the brain. A widely
  used valuation term in formal learning and decision-making models is the
  reward prediction error: the value of an outcome relative to its expected
  value. An influential theory (Holroyd \& Coles, 2002) claims that an
  electrophysiological component, feedback related negativity (FRN), codes a
  reward prediction error in the human brain. Such a component should be
  sensitive to both the prior likelihood of reward and its magnitude on receipt.
  A number of studies have found the FRN to be insensitive to reward magnitude,
  thus questioning the Holroyd and Coles account. However, because of marked
  inconsistencies in how the FRN is measured, a meaningful synthesis of this
  evidence is highly problematic. We conducted a meta-analysis of the FRN's
  response to both reward magnitude and likelihood using a novel method in which
  published effect sizes were disregarded in favor of direct measurement of the
  published waveforms themselves, with these waveforms then averaged to produce
  "great grand averages." Under this standardized measure, the meta-analysis
  revealed strong effects of magnitude and likelihood on the FRN, consistent
  with it encoding a reward prediction error. In addition, it revealed strong
  main effects of reward magnitude and likelihood across much of the waveform,
  indicating sensitivity to unsigned prediction errors or "salience." The great
  grand average technique is proposed as a general method for meta-analysis of
  event-related potential (ERP).},

  difficult, and the target-classification task is easy. To assess whether this

  we manipulated the ease of the prime-classification task by intermixing
  long-duration (visible) primes with short-duration (near liminal) ones. In
  Experiment 1, this strategy of intermixing long-duration primes raised
  classification of the short-duration ones. In Experiments 2 and 3, prime
  duration was lowered in such a way that prime classification was at chance in

  limit, but that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article
  brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the
  smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in analyses of
  information processing only if the boundary conditions for observing them can
  be carefully described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be
  identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when
  information overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when
  other steps are taken specifically to block the recording of stimulus items
  into larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by the capacity
  limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these
  conditions, rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus
  items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms that are not
  capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the capacity-limited storage
  mechanism to be refilled during recall. A single, central capacity limit
  averaging about four chunks is implicated along with other,
  noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks
  is distinguished from compound STM limits obtained when the number of
  separately held chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall
  within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the focus of

  This chapter strives to reduce that confusion and makes up-to-date assessments

  fundamental ways, with only short-term memory demonstrating (1) temporal decay
  and (2) chunk capacity limits. Both properties of short-term memory are still
  controversial but the current literature is rather encouraging regarding the
  existence of both decay and capacity limits. Working memory has been conceived
  and defined in three different, slightly discrepant ways: as short-term memory
  applied to cognitive tasks, as a multi-component system that holds and
  manipulates information in short-term memory, and as the use of attention to
  manage short-term memory. Regardless of the definition, there are some
  measures of memory in the short term that seem routine and do not correlate
  well with cognitive aptitudes and other measures (those usually identified
  with the term "working memory") that seem more attention demanding and do
  correlate well with these aptitudes. The evidence is evaluated and placed

  Thus, the object working memory subsystem--not the spatial working memory
  subsystem--provides the buffer in which object representations are stored

  response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of
  distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete
  distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling
  not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the
  distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth)
  functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum
  (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A
  Newton–Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized)
  likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting
  algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data
  sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologists are often interested in estimating the
  risk of several related diseases as well as adverse outcomes, which have a
  natural ordering of severity or certainty. While most investigators choose to
  model several dichotomous outcomes (such as very low birthweight versus normal
  and moderately low birthweight versus normal), this approach does not fully
  utilize the available information. Several statistical models for ordinal
  responses have been proposed, but have been underutilized. In this paper, we
  describe statistical methods for modelling ordinal response data, and
  illustrate the fit of these models to a large database from a perinatal health
  programme. METHODS: Models considered here include (1) the cumulative logit
  model, (2) continuation-ratio model, (3) constrained and unconstrained partial
  proportional odds models, (4) adjacent-category logit model, (5) polytomous
  logistic model, and (6) stereotype logistic model. We illustrate and compare
  the fit of these models on a perinatal database, to study the impact of
  midline episiotomy procedure on perineal lacerations during labour and
  delivery. Finally, we provide a discussion on graphical methods for the
  assessment of model assumptions and model constraints, and conclude with a
  discussion on the choice of an ordinal model. The primary focus in this paper
  is the formulation of ordinal models, interpretation of model parameters, and
  their implications for epidemiological research. CONCLUSIONS: This paper
  presents a synthesized review of generalized linear regression models for
  analysing ordered responses. We recommend that the analyst performs (i)
  goodness-of-fit tests and an analysis of residuals, (ii) sensitivity analysis
  by fitting and comparing different models, and (iii) by graphically examining

  emotion recognition accuracy and social and emotional problems in the ADHD
  group. 83 children displaying ADHD symptoms and 30 controls (6-12 years)
  completed the Morphed Facial Emotion Recognition Task (MFERT). The MFERT
  assesses emotion recognition accuracy on four emotions using five expression
  intensity levels. Teachers and parents rated social and emotional problems on
  the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Repeated measures analysis of
  variance revealed that the ADHD group showed poorer emotion recognition
  accuracy compared to controls across emotions (small effect). The significant
  group by expression intensity interaction (small effect) showed that the
  increase in accuracy with increasing expression intensity was smaller in the
  ADHD group compared to controls. Multiple regression analyses within the ADHD
  group showed that emotion recognition accuracy was inversely related to social
  and emotional problems, but not prosocial behavior. Not only children with an
  ADHD diagnosis, but also children with subthreshold ADHD experience
  impairments in facial emotion recognition. This impairment is predictive for
  social and emotional problems, which may suggest that emotion recognition may
  contribute to the development of social and emotional problems in these

  onset in animated morph clips displaying facial expressions that slowly
  changed from neutral to emotional. RESULTS: ADHD participants exhibited an
  impaired recognition of sad and fearful facial expressions. CONCLUSION: The

  abstract = {The evaluation of agreement among experts in a classification task
  is crucial in many situations (e.g., medical and psychological diagnosis,
  legal reports). Traditional indexes used to estimate interrater agreement
  (such as Cohen's j) simply count the number of observed agreements and correct
  them by removing chance agreements. In this article, we introduce a new
  theoretical framework for the evaluation of interrater agreement based on the
  possibility of adjusting the observed classifications conducted by the raters.
  This framework refers to the introduction and formalization of two concepts
  involved in the classification task: (a) the belonging measure of an object to
  a category and (b) the rater's belonging threshold, which is the minimally
  sufficient value of the belonging measure at which the rater will classify an
  object into a category. These factors are ignored by traditional indexes for
  interrater agreement, though their role may be decisive. Two Bayesian models
  are tested through a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the accuracy of
  the new methodology for estimating raters' threshold and the actual degree of
  agreement between two independent raters. Results show that the computation of
  traditional indexes for interrater agreement on the adjusted classifications
  leads to a more accurate estimation of the experts' actual agreement. This
  improvement is greater when a large difference between raters' belonging
  thresholds is observed; when the difference is small, the proposed method
  provides similar results to those obtained in the simple observed
  classifications. Finally, an empirical application to the field of
  psychological assessment is presented to show how the method could be used in
  practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).},

  neuroimaging is to identify brain regions as contiguous supra-threshold
  clusters, check their significance using random field theory, and correct for
  the multiple clusters being tested. Besides recent criticism on the validity
  of the random field assumption, a spatial specificity paradox remains: the
  larger the detected cluster, the less we know about the location of activation
  within that cluster. This is because cluster inference implies "there exists
  at least one voxel with an evoked response in the cluster", and not that "all
  the voxels in the cluster have an evoked response". Inference on voxels within
  selected clusters is considered bad practice, due to the voxel-wise false
  positive rate inflation associated with this circular inference. Here, we
  propose a remedy to the spatial specificity paradox. By applying recent
  results from the multiple testing statistical literature, we are able to
  quantify the proportion of truly active voxels within selected clusters, an
  approach we call All-Resolutions Inference (ARI). If this proportion is high,
  the paradox vanishes. If it is low, we can further "drill down" from the
  cluster level to sub-regions, and even to individual voxels, in order to
  pinpoint the origin of the activation. In fact, ARI allows inference on the
  proportion of activation in all voxel sets, no matter how large or small,
  however these have been selected, all from the same data. We use two fMRI
  datasets to demonstrate the non-triviality of the spatial specificity paradox,
  and its resolution using ARI. We verify that the endless circularity permitted
  by ARI does not render its estimates overly conservative using both
  simulation, and a data split.},

  "Unconscious Memory Representations in Perception "focuses on the role of
  implicit (non-conscious) memories in processing sensory information. Making
  sense of the wealth of information arriving at our senses requires implicit
  memories, which represent environmental regularities, contingencies of the
  sensory input, as well as general contextual knowledge. Recent findings and
  theories in cognitive and computational neuroscience provided new insights
  into the structure and contents of implicit memory representations. The
  chapters of this book examine implicit memories both in relatively simple
  situations, such as perceiving auditory and visual objects, as well as in
  high?level cognitive functions, such as speech and music perception and
  aesthetic experience. By nature, implicit memories cannot be directly studied
  with behavioral methods. Therefore, a large part of the evidence reviewed was
  obtained in neuroscientific studies. Readers with limited experience in
  neuroscience will find information about the most commonly used techniques in
  the appendix of this volume. (Series B)},

  neurocognition (SMD = 0.12, 95\% CI = [-0.12, 0.34]). There was moderate
  between study heterogeneity for social cognition outcomes (τs= 0.12).
  Moderator analyses revealed that IN-OT had a significantly larger effect on
  high-level social cognition (ie, mentalizing and theory of mind) compared to
  low-level social cognition (ie, social cue perception) (b = 0.19, 95\% CI =

  cognition, there was a significant effect of IN-OT (SMD = 0.20, 95 \% CI =

  present analysis indicates that IN-OT may have selective effects on high-level
  social cognition, which provides a more focused target for future studies of

  observed in clinical populations with a deficit in the recognition of facial

  most informative. However, we found an underutilization of the eye area by
  human participants in comparison to the ideal observer. We then demonstrated
  that the mouth area contains the most discriminative motions across
  expressions. We propose that the greater utilization of the mouth area by the
  human participants might come from remnants of the strategy the brain has
  developed with dynamic stimuli, and/or from a strategy whereby the most
  informative area is prioritized due to the limited capacity of the
  visuo-cognitive system.},

  Since tempting actions are often contextually inappropriate, selective
  suppression is invoked to inhibit such actions. Thus far, laboratory tasks
  have not been very successful in highlighting these processes. We suggest that
  this is for three reasons. First, it is important to dissociate between an
  early susceptibility to making stimulus-driven impulsive but erroneous
  actions, and the subsequent selective suppression of these impulses that
  facilitates the selection of the correct action. Second, studies have focused
  on mean or median reaction times (RT), which conceals the temporal dynamics of
  action control. Third, studies have focused on group means, while considering
  individual differences as a source of error variance. Here, we present an
  overview of recent behavioral and imaging studies that overcame these
  limitations by analyzing RT distributions. As will become clear, this approach
  has revealed variations in inhibitory control over impulsive actions as a
  function of task instructions, conflict probability, and between-trial
  adjustments (following conflict or following an error trial) that are hidden
  if mean RTs are analyzed. Next, we discuss a selection of behavioral as well
  as imaging studies to illustrate that individual differences are meaningful
  and help understand selective suppression during action selection within
  samples of young and healthy individuals, but also within clinical samples of
  patients diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or
  Parkinson's disease.},

  mouth region is driving fast correct responses (but not fast incorrect
  responses)-the gender discrimination information in the mouth region is
  concentrated in the red-green color channel. Together, these results suggest
  that, when color is informative in the mouth region, humans use it and respond

  the sample size that will be collected. The key aim of a sample size
  justification for such studies is to explain how the collected data is
  expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the
  researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify
  the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from
  (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource
  constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a
  desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the
  absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying
  sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to
  which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes.
  Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider
  1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size
  will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what
  they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected
  based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of
  effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power
  analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area.
  Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article, for example by
  using the interactive form in the accompanying online Shiny app, to improve
  their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value

  representations of objectively invisible faces and houses are limited to
  visual (shape-related) object properties, while subjectively invisible stimuli

  intuitively appealing and comprehensible by non-statisticians, is based on a

  results indicate that when the studies are heterogeneous (that is, when they

  publication bias where none exists. We found that trim and fill may spuriously
  adjust for non-existent bias if (i) the variability among studies causes some
  precisely estimated studies to have effects far from the global mean or (ii)
  an inverse relationship between treatment efficacy and sample size is
  introduced by the studies' a priori power calculations. The results suggest
  that the funnel plot itself is inappropriate for heterogeneous meta-analyses.
  Selection modelling is an alternative method warranting further study. It
  performed better than trim and fill in our simulations, although its frequency

  individuals' performance in a task varies gradually in a continuous fashion.
  In a Stroop task, for example, the true average effect may be 50 ms with a
  standard deviation of say 30 ms. In this case, some individuals will have
  greater effects than 50 ms, some will have smaller, and some are forecasted to
  have negative effects in sign-they respond faster to incongruent items than to
  congruent ones! But are there people who have a true negative effect in Stroop
  or any other task? We highlight three qualitatively different effects:
  negative effects, null effects, and positive effects. The main goal of this
  paper is to develop models that allow researchers to explore whether all three
  are present in a task: Do all individuals show a positive effect? Are there
  individuals with truly no effect? Are there any individuals with negative
  effects? We develop a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that capture a
  variety of these constraints. We apply this approach to Stroop interference
  experiments and a near-liminal priming experiment where the prime may be below
  and above threshold for different people. We show that most tasks people are
  quite alike-for example everyone has positive Stroop effects and nobody fails
  to Stroop or Stroops negatively. We also show a case that under very specific

  abstract = {In masking, a stimulus is rendered invisible through the
  presentation of a second stimulus shortly after the first. Over the years,
  authors have typically explained masking by postulating some early disruption
  process. In these feedforward-type explanations, the mask somehow "catches up"
  with the target stimulus, disrupting its processing either through lateral or
  interchannel inhibition. However, studies from recent years indicate that
  visual perception--and most notably visual awareness itself--may depend
  strongly on cortico-cortical feedback connections from higher to lower visual
  areas. This has led some researchers to propose that masking derives its
  effectiveness from selectively interrupting these reentrant processes. In this
  experiment, we used electroencephalogram measurements to determine what
  happens in the human visual cortex during detection of a texture-defined
  square under nonmasked (seen) and masked (unseen) conditions.
  Electro-encephalogram derivatives that are typically associated with reentrant
  processing turn out to be absent in the masked condition. Moreover,
  extrastriate visual areas are still activated early on by both seen and unseen
  stimuli, as shown by scalp surface Laplacian current source-density maps. This
  conclusively shows that feedforward processing is preserved, even when subject
  performance is at chance as determined by objective measures. From these
  results, we conclude that masking derives its effectiveness, at least partly,
  from disrupting reentrant processing, thereby interfering with the neural
  mechanisms of figure-ground segmentation and visual awareness itself.},

  literature on facial mimicry of emotion displays, we conclude that the classic
  matched motor hypothesis does not hold for emotional mimicry. We alternatively
  propose a contextual view of emotional mimicry, which states that emotional
  mimicry depends on the social context: we only mimic emotional signals that
  are interpreted to promote affiliation goals and not necessarily what we see.
  As a further consequence, we are less likely to mimic strangers and we do not

  to perfect performance. A second summary parameter used to describe
  performance is the slope of the psychometric function, which is a measure of
  how rapidly performance changes with a given change in stimulus value. Often,
  sen-sory capabilities can be adequately described by a thresh-old measure
  alone—that is, one single point on the psy-chometric function. However, in the
  method of constant stimuli, the threshold is extracted from a fully sampled
  function, making the measurement of this single point on the function very
  expensive in terms of experiment time. Of necessity, many trials are placed at
  stimulus levels of the underlying psychometric function that are not
  infor-mative about threshold. It is necessary to have informa-tion about
  performance at these off-threshold levels in order to fully develop the
  psychometric function, but in many cases that additional information is
  neither neces-sary to the goals of the experiment nor worth the extra
  ex-perimental time and effort. Adaptive psychometric proce-dures have been
  developed to address this major problem in psychophysical measurement—that is,
  an inefficient placement of trials along the stimulus array in order to
  ex-tract a relevant measure. An experimental procedure is adaptive if the
  placement of each trial along the stimulus array is determined by the results
  of the trial or trials that have gone before. It is a characteristic of all
  adaptive pro-cedures that knowledge about the outcome (e.g., a thresh-old)
  increases systematically as the procedure is in progress. That is, the
  selection of stimuli is determined during the course of the experiment, and
  stimulus placement is dri-ven by the adaptive algorithm toward the desired
  mea-surement point. Adaptive procedures are designed to rapidly extract
  rel-evant measurements from a psychometric function thought to underlie
  performance on a given sensory/perceptual task. Generally, two types of
  measures are of interest: lo-cation along a stimulus axis (e.g., threshold)
  and the slope of the function (how rapidly performance changes with changes in
  stimulus values). Often, only a location mea-sure is required, but there are
  some investigations whose goal is a more complete description of the
  underlying function, requiring both location and slope measures. The
  procedures themselves involve two separate parts: place-ment of trials along a
  stimulus axis and analysis of the data obtained to extract characteristics of
  the underlying psy-chometric functions. The challenge of adaptive
  psychophysics is to make rel-evant observations on the psychometric function
  with maximum efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Adap-tive methods of
  measurement have been developed with the goal of preserving accuracy and
  reliability, while maxi-mizing efficiency and minimizing subject and
  experimenter time. This article will trace the development of modern adaptive
  procedures, with special attention to the strengths and weaknesses of three of
  the most commonly used meth-ods. In addition, some special applications will
  be discussed, including the use of these procedures to monitor changes in
  performance that are due to learning or attentional lapses by subjects, as
  well as some characteristics of adaptive meth-ods that become important with
  application to more com-plex applications or in studying multidimensional
  stimuli, such as speech. The reader is directed to Treutwein (1995) for an
  excellent, quantitative description of psychometric functions and adaptive

  occipitotemporal regions in extrastriate visual cortex that mediate the visual
  analysis of faces. In the core system, the representation of invariant aspects
  is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the fusiform gyrus, whereas
  the representation of changeable aspects is mediated more by the

  recent evidence suggests the intriguing possibility that NDEs may refer to
  actually "perceived," and stored, experiences (although not necessarily in
  relation to the external physical world). We adopted an integrated approach
  involving a hypnosis-based clinical protocol to improve recall and decrease
  memory inaccuracy together with electroencephalography (EEG) recording in
  order to investigate the characteristics of NDE memories and their neural
  markers compared to memories of both real and imagined events. We included 10
  participants with NDEs, defined by the Greyson NDE scale, and 10 control
  subjects without NDE. Memories were assessed using the Memory Characteristics
  Questionnaire. Our hypnosis-based protocol increased the amount of details in
  the recall of all kind of memories considered (NDE, real, and imagined
  events). Findings showed that NDE memories were similar to real memories in
  terms of detail richness, self-referential, and emotional information.
  Moreover, NDE memories were significantly different from memories of imagined
  events. The pattern of EEG results indicated that real memory recall was
  positively associated with two memory-related frequency bands, i.e., high
  alpha and gamma. NDE memories were linked with theta band, a well-known marker
  of episodic memory. The recall of NDE memories was also related to delta band,
  which indexes processes such as the recollection of the past, as well as
  trance states, hallucinations, and other related portals to transpersonal
  experience. It is notable that the EEG pattern of correlations for NDE memory
  recall differed from the pattern for memories of imagined events. In
  conclusion, our findings suggest that, at a phenomenological level, NDE
  memories cannot be considered equivalent to imagined memories, and at a neural
  level, NDE memories are stored as episodic memories of events experienced in a
  peculiar state of consciousness.},

  this theory by examining facial expression recognition in participants with

  the recognition of facial identity or objects, or in lower-level visual

  by nonprogressive congenital uni- or bi-lateral facial (i. e. VII cranial
  nerve) and abducens (i. e. VI cranial nerve) palsy. Although the neurological
  and ophthalmological findings are quite well-known, data concerning the
  attendant functional difficulties and their changes over time are seldom
  addressed. In this study we attempt to estimate the prevalence of clinical and
  functional data in an Italian cohort affected by MBS. METHODS: The study
  included 50 children, 21 males and 29 females, aged 1 month to 14 years. The
  patients entered into a multidisciplinary diagnostic and follow-up protocol
  that had the specific purpose of detecting clinical and developmental deficits
  related to MBS. RESULTS: Involvement of the VII cranial nerve (total/partial,
  bilateral or unilateral) was present in 96 \% of patients, and of the VI nerve
  in 85 \%. Two patients were without impairment of the VII nerve and seven
  patients had no involvement of the VI nerve and were thus classified as
  Moebius-like because of the involvement of other CNs. Additional affected CNs
  were numbers III-IV in 16 \%, V in 11 \%, VIII and X each in 8 \%, the XI in 6
  \%, the IX, most often partially, in 22 \%, and the XII in 48 \% of cases.
  Their development was characterized by global delay at one year of age, motor,
  emotional and speech difficulties at two years of age, a trend toward
  normalization at three years of age but with weakness in hand-eye
  coordination, and achieving average results at five years of age. Overall 90
  \% of children had a normal developmental quotient whereas only 10 \%
  manifested cognitive deficits. CONCLUSION: Early rehabilitation may enhance
  the recovery of normal function, particularly in vulnerable areas of
  development. It is possible that early intervention that integrates sensory
  and visual information with emotional difficulties can improve the prognosis
  of the child with MBS.},

  recognized by the unconscious mimicking of observed facial expressions, which
  requires the implicit activation of the motor programs that produce a specific
  expression. Motor responses performed during the expression of a given emotion
  are hypothesized to be directly linked to autonomic responses associated with
  that emotional behavior. We tested this hypothesis in 9 children (Mage = 5.66)
  affected by Moebius syndrome (MBS) and 15 control children (Mage = 6.6). MBS
  is a neurological congenital disorder characterized by underdevelopment of the
  VI and VII cranial nerves, which results in paralysis of the face. Moebius
  patients' inability to produce facial expressions impairs their capacity to
  communicate emotions through the face. We therefore assessed Moebius
  children's autonomic response to emotional stimuli (video cartoons) by means
  of functional infrared thermal (fIRT) imaging. Patients showed weaker
  temperature changes compared to controls, suggesting impaired autonomic
  activity. They also showed difficulties in recognizing facial emotions from
  static illustrations. These findings reveal that the impairment of facial
  movement attenuates the intensity of emotional experience, probably through
  the diminished activation of autonomic responses associated with emotional
  stimuli. The current study is the first to investigate emotional responses in
  MBS children, providing important insights into the role of facial expressions

  abstract = {Faces are among the most important visual stimuli we perceive,
  informing us not only about a person's identity, but also about their mood,
  sex, age and direction of gaze. The ability to extract this information within
  a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social
  interactions and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our
  primate ancestors. Considerable evidence from behavioural, neuropsychological
  and neurophysiological investigations supports the hypothesis that humans have
  specialized cognitive and neural mechanisms dedicated to the perception of
  faces (the face-specificity hypothesis). Here, we review the literature on a
  region of the human brain that appears to play a key role in face perception,
  known as the fusiform face area (FFA). Section 1 outlines the theoretical
  background for much of this work. The face-specificity hypothesis falls
  squarely on one side of a longstanding debate in the fields of cognitive
  science and cognitive neuroscience concerning the extent to which the
  mind/brain is composed of: (i) special-purpose ('domain-specific') mechanisms,
  each dedicated to processing a specific kind of information (e.g. faces,
  according to the face-specificity hypothesis), versus (ii) general-purpose
  ('domain-general') mechanisms, each capable of operating on any kind of
  information. Face perception has long served both as one of the prime
  candidates of a domain-specific process and as a key target for attack by
  proponents of domain-general theories of brain and mind. Section 2 briefly
  reviews the prior literature on face perception from behaviour and
  neurophysiology. This work supports the face-specificity hypothesis and argues
  against its domain-general alternatives (the individuation hypothesis, the
  expertise hypothesis and others). Section 3 outlines the more recent evidence
  on this debate from brain imaging, focusing particularly on the FFA. We review
  the evidence that the FFA is selectively engaged in face perception, by
  addressing (and rebutting) five of the most widely discussed alternatives to
  this hypothesis. In section 4, we consider recent findings that are beginning
  to provide clues into the computations conducted in the FFA and the nature of
  the representations the FFA extracts from faces. We argue that the FFA is
  engaged both in detecting faces and in extracting the necessary perceptual
  information to recognize them, and that the properties of the FFA mirror
  previously identified behavioural signatures of face-specific processing (e.g.
  the face-inversion effect). Section 5 asks how the computations and
  representations in the FFA differ from those occurring in other nearby regions
  of cortex that respond strongly to faces and objects. The evidence indicates
  clear functional dissociations between these regions, demonstrating that the
  FFA shows not only functional specificity but also area specificity. We end by
  speculating in section 6 on some of the broader questions raised by current
  research on the FFA, including the developmental origins of this region and
  the question of whether faces are unique versus whether similarly specialized
  mechanisms also exist for other domains of high-level perception and
  cognition.},

  "components" derived from averaging EEG responses across trials and subjects
  (generating the event-related potential, ERP). First, we review methods for
  deriving features from EEG in order to enhance the signal within
  single-trials. These methods include filtering based on user-defined features
  (i.e., frequency decomposition, time-frequency decomposition), filtering based
  on data-driven properties (i.e., blind source separation, BSS), and generating
  more abstract representations of data (e.g., using deep learning). We then
  review cognitive models which extract latent variables from experimental
  tasks, including the drift diffusion model (DDM) and reinforcement learning
  (RL) approaches. Next, we discuss ways to access associations among these
  measures, including statistical models, data-driven joint models and cognitive
  joint modeling using hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs). We think that these

  per-subject proportion of "successes" and "failures" over a finite number of
  trials often arise. This clustered binary data are usually non-normally
  distributed, which can distort inference if the usual general linear model is
  applied and sample size is small. A number of more advanced methods is
  available, but they are often technically challenging and a comparative
  assessment of their performances in behavioral setups has not been performed.
  METHOD: We studied the performances of some methods applicable to the analysis
  of proportions; namely linear regression, Poisson regression, beta-binomial
  regression and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs). We report on a
  simulation study evaluating power and Type I error rate of these models in
  hypothetical scenarios met by behavioral researchers; plus, we describe
  results from the application of these methods on data from real experiments.
  RESULTS: Our results show that, while GLMMs are powerful instruments for the
  analysis of clustered binary outcomes, beta-binomial regression can outperform
  them in a range of scenarios. Linear regression gave results consistent with
  the nominal level of significance, but was overall less powerful. Poisson
  regression, instead, mostly led to anticonservative inference. COMPARISON WITH
  EXISTING METHODS: GLMMs and beta-binomial regression are generally more
  powerful than linear regression; yet linear regression is robust to model
  misspecification in some conditions, whereas Poisson regression suffers
  heavily from violations of the assumptions when used to model proportion data.
  CONCLUSIONS: We conclude providing directions to behavioral scientists dealing
  with clustered binary data and small sample sizes.},

  ratings predict task performance. We explored various hypotheses about the
  relationship between perceptual task performance and visibility rating by
  implementing them in computational models and using formal model comparison
  techniques to assess which ones best captured the unusual patterns in the
  data. The models fell into three broad categories: Single Channel models,
  which hold that task performance and visibility ratings are based on the same
  underlying source of information; Dual Channel models, which hold that there
  are two independent processing streams that differentially contribute to task
  performance and visibility rating; and Hierarchical models, which hold that a
  late processing stage generates visibility ratings by evaluating the quality
  of early perceptual processing. Taking into account the quality of data
  fitting and model complexity, we found that Hierarchical models perform best
  at capturing the observed behavioral dissociations. Because current theories
  of visual awareness map well onto these different model structures, a formal
  comparison between them is a powerful approach for arbitrating between the
  different theories.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deficits in face emotion perception are among the most
  pervasive aspects of schizophrenia impairments which strongly affects
  interpersonal communication and social skills. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
  Schizophrenic patients (PSZ) and healthy control subjects (HCS) performed 2
  psychophysical tasks. One, the SAFFIMAP test, was designed to determine the
  impact of subliminally presented affective or neutral images on the accuracy
  of face-expression (angry or neutral) perception. In the second test, FEP,
  subjects saw pictures of face-expression and were asked to rate them as angry,
  happy, or neutral. The following clinical scales were used to determine the
  acute symptoms in PSZ: Positive and Negative Syndrome (PANSS), Young Mania
  Rating (YMRS), Hamilton Depression (HAM-D), and Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A).
  RESULTS: On the SAFFIMAP test, different from the HCS group, the PSZ group
  tended to categorize the neutral expression of test faces as angry and their
  response to the test-face expression was not influenced by the affective
  content of the primes. In PSZ, the PANSS-positive score was significantly
  correlated with correct perception of angry faces for aggressive or pleasant
  primes. YMRS scores were strongly correlated with PSZ's tendency to recognize
  angry face expressions when the prime was a pleasant or a neutral image. The
  HAM-D score was positively correlated with categorizing the test-faces as
  neutral, regardless of the affective content of the prime or of the test-face
  expression (angry or neutral). CONCLUSIONS: Despite its exploratory nature,
  this study provides the first evidence that conscious perception and
  categorization of facial emotions (neutral or angry) in PSZ is directly
  affected by their positive or negative symptoms of the disease as defined by
  their individual scores on the clinical diagnostic scales.},

  makes them the ideal population to study whether facial mimicry is necessary

  participants could freely use their facial mimicry whereas in the other half,
  they had their facial mimicry blocked by a gel. Our results revealed that, on
  average, both P1 and N170 ERP components were not sensitive to mimicry
  manipulation. However, when taking into account alexithymic traits, a scenario
  corroborating sensorimotor simulation models emerged, with two dissociable
  temporal windows affected by mimicry manipulation as a function of alexithymia
  levels. Specifically, as a function of mimicry manipulation, individuals with
  lower alexithymic traits showed modulations of the P1 amplitude, while
  individuals with higher alexithymic traits showed modulations of the later
  N170). Furthermore, connectivity analysis at the scalp level suggested
  increased connectivity between sensorimotor and extrastriate visual regions in

  Broca's aphasia. However, several individuals with other aphasic patterns had
  considerable damage to pars opercularis, suggesting that involvement of this

  Wernicke's area) than those with other aphasia types. Using discriminant
  function analysis and logistic regression, based on proportional damage to the
  pars opercularis and Wernicke's area, to predict whether individuals had
  Broca's or another types of aphasia, over 95\% were classified correctly. Our

  measured intelligence with only one or two subtests. Additionally, the sample
  sizes upon which previous investigations were based were relatively small
  (N=45 to 80). Consequently, in this investigation, a battery of eight
  cognitive ability tests and the CFMT were administered to a relatively large
  number of participants (N=211). Based on a correlated-factor model, memory for

  short-term memory (.23) and lexical knowledge ability (.19). Additionally,
  based on a higher-order model, memory for faces was found to be associated

  cognitive ability within the Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence,
  rather than a special ability (i.e., independent of other abilities). Future

  ability is encouraged (e.g., long-term memory), as the CFMT is a measure of

  abstract = {Until recently, it has been thought that under interocular
  suppression high-level visual processing is strongly inhibited if not
  abolished. With the development of continuous flash suppression (CFS), a
  variant of binocular rivalry, this notion has now been challenged by a number
  of reports showing that even high-level aspects of visual stimuli, such as
  familiarity, affect the time stimuli need to overcome CFS and emerge into
  awareness. In this "breaking continuous flash suppression" (b-CFS) paradigm,
  differential unconscious processing during suppression is inferred when (a)
  speeded detection responses to initially invisible stimuli differ, and (b) no
  comparable differences are found in non-rivalrous control conditions supposed
  to measure non-specific threshold differences between stimuli. The aim of the
  present study was to critically evaluate these assumptions. In six experiments
  we compared the detection of upright and inverted faces. We found that not
  only under CFS, but also in control conditions upright faces were detected
  faster and more accurately than inverted faces, although the effect was larger
  during CFS. However, reaction time (RT) distributions indicated critical
  differences between the CFS and the control condition. When RT distributions
  were matched, similar effect sizes were obtained in both conditions. Moreover,
  subjective ratings revealed that CFS and control conditions are not
  perceptually comparable. These findings cast doubt on the usefulness of
  non-rivalrous control conditions to rule out non-specific threshold
  differences as a cause of shorter detection latencies during CFS. Thus, at
  least in its present form, the b-CFS paradigm cannot provide unequivocal
  evidence for unconscious processing under interocular suppression.
  Nevertheless, our findings also demonstrate that the b-CFS paradigm can be
  fruitfully applied as a highly sensitive device to probe differences between
  stimuli in their potency to gain access to awareness.},

  to unexpected processing conflict caused by salient emotional stimuli.
  Participants with higher anxiety levels showed both less rostral ACC activity

  associated with reduced top-down control over threat-related distractors. Our

  nonlinear input-state-output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the
  dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit causal
  model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the
  influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate
  intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow
  the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian
  framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the
  system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity
  using experimentally designed inputs and fMRI responses. In this context, the
  coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear
  parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing
  framework allows one to characterise fMRI experiments, conceptually, as an
  experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or
  trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked
  responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with
  previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally
  induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However,
  unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes
  responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as
  unknown and stochastic.},

  for this parameter. We summarise the performance of methods in relation to
  estimation of heterogeneity and of the overall effect estimate, and of
  confidence intervals for the latter. Among the twelve included simulation
  studies, the DerSimonian and Laird method was most commonly evaluated. This
  estimate is negatively biased when heterogeneity is moderate to high and
  therefore most studies recommended alternatives. The Paule-Mandel method was
  recommended by three studies: it is simple to implement, is less biased than
  DerSimonian and Laird and performs well in meta-analyses with dichotomous and
  continuous outcomes. In many of the included simulation studies, results were
  based on data that do not represent meta-analyses observed in practice, and
  only small selections of methods were compared. Furthermore, potential
  conflicts of interest were present when authors of novel methods interpreted
  their results. On the basis of current evidence, we provisionally recommend
  the Paule-Mandel method for estimating the heterogeneity variance, and using
  this estimate to calculate the mean effect and its 95\% confidence interval.
  However, further simulation studies are required to draw firm conclusions.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: When multiple endpoints are of interest in evidence
  synthesis, a multivariate meta-analysis can jointly synthesise those endpoints
  and utilise their correlation. A multivariate random-effects meta-analysis
  must incorporate and estimate the between-study correlation (rhoB). METHODS:
  In this paper we assess maximum likelihood estimation of a general normal
  model and a generalised model for bivariate random-effects meta-analysis
  (BRMA). We consider two applied examples, one involving a diagnostic marker
  and the other a surrogate outcome. These motivate a simulation study where
  estimation properties from BRMA are compared with those from two separate
  univariate random-effects meta-analyses (URMAs), the traditional approach.
  RESULTS: The normal BRMA model estimates rhoB as -1 in both applied examples.
  Analytically we show this is due to the maximum likelihood estimator sensibly
  truncating the between-study covariance matrix on the boundary of its
  parameter space. Our simulations reveal this commonly occurs when the number
  of studies is small or the within-study variation is relatively large; it also
  causes upwardly biased between-study variance estimates, which are inflated to
  compensate for the restriction on rhoB. Importantly, this does not induce any
  systematic bias in the pooled estimates and produces conservative standard
  errors and mean-square errors. Furthermore, the normal BRMA is preferable to
  two normal URMAs; the mean-square error and standard error of pooled estimates
  is generally smaller in the BRMA, especially given data missing at random. For
  meta-analysis of proportions we then show that a generalised BRMA model is
  better still. This correctly uses a binomial rather than normal distribution,
  and produces better estimates than the normal BRMA and also two generalised
  URMAs; however the model may sometimes not converge due to difficulties
  estimating rhoB. CONCLUSION: A BRMA model offers numerous advantages over
  separate univariate synthesises; this paper highlights some of these benefits
  in both a normal and generalised modelling framework, and examines the
  estimation of between-study correlation to aid practitioners.},

  assumption of homogeneity is often unrealistic and can result in
  underestimation of parameter uncertainty. Random-effects meta-analysis and
  meta-regression are therefore typically used to accommodate explained and
  unexplained between-study variability. However, it is not unusual to obtain a
  boundary estimate of zero for the (residual) between-study standard deviation,
  resulting in fixed-effects estimates of the other parameters and their
  standard errors. To avoid such boundary estimates, we suggest using Bayes
  modal (BM) estimation with a gamma prior on the between-study standard
  deviation. When no prior information is available regarding the magnitude of
  the between-study standard deviation, a weakly informative default prior can
  be used (with shape parameter 2 and rate parameter close to 0) that produces
  positive estimates but does not overrule the data, leading to only a small
  decrease in the log likelihood from its maximum. We review the most commonly
  used estimation methods for meta-analysis and meta-regression including
  classical and Bayesian methods and apply these methods, as well as our BM
  estimator, to real datasets. We then perform simulations to compare BM
  estimation with the other methods and find that BM estimation performs well by
  (i) avoiding boundary estimates; (ii) having smaller root mean squared error
  for the between-study standard deviation; and (iii) better coverage for the
  overall effects than the other methods when the true model has at least a
  small or moderate amount of unexplained heterogeneity.},

  late 1950s, the honoree of this special issue, Charles Eriksen, was among a
  small group of early pioneers that sought to investigate whether a transient
  increase in overall level of attention (alertness) in response to a noxious
  stimulus can be decoupled from conscious perception using experimental
  techniques. Recent years saw a similar debate regarding whether attention and
  consciousness are two dissociable processes. Initial evidence that attention

  data. However, the past couple of years witnessed an explosion of studies
  aimed at testing this conjecture using neuroscientific techniques. Here we
  provide an overview of these and related empirical studies on the distinction
  between the neuronal correlates of attention and consciousness, and detail how
  advancements in theory and technology can bring about a more detailed

  priming across the literature and to determine whether subliminal primes are
  processed semantically, and second, to examine potential moderators of priming
  effects. The authors found significant priming in their analyses, indicating
  that unconsciously presented information can influence behavior. Furthermore,
  priming was observed under circumstances in which a nonsemantic interpretation
  could not fully explain the effects, suggesting that subliminally presented
  information can be processed semantically. Nonetheless, the nonsemantic
  processing of primes is enhanced and priming effects are boosted when the

  approximately 500 ms of each other, subjects are often unable to report the
  second of the two targets (T2) accurately, even though the first has been
  reported correctly. In contrast, subjects can report T2 accurately when
  instructed to ignore T1, or when T1 and T2 are separated by more than 500 ms.
  The above pattern of results has been labelled the attentional blink (AB).
  Experiments have revealed that the AB is not the result of perceptual, memory
  or response output limitations. In general, the various theories advanced to
  account for the AB, although they differ in the specific mechanisms purported
  to be responsible, assume that allocating attention to T1 leaves less
  attention for T2, rendering T2 vulnerable to decay or substitution. The
  present report attempts to bring together these various accounts by proposing
  a unifying theory. This report also highlights recent attempts to determine if
  the AB exists across stimulus modalities and points to applications of AB
  methods in understanding deficits of visual neglect. We conclude by suggesting
  that investigations of the AB argue in favour of the view that attention may
  be thought of as a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for enabling

  including examples where top-down attention and consciousness have opposing

  pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.
  This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the
  details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling
  work. The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel
  models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory
  and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to
  advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data,
  and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding. The
  second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal
  inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains
  new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered
  categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance
  sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an
  entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how
  domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.

  Such capacity is often assumed to be relatively automatic in nature and rely
  on stimulus-driven activity in low-level cortical areas. Instead, here we
  asked to what extent neural activity before stimulus presentation influences
  subliminal perception. We asked participants to discriminate the location of a
  briefly presented low-contrast visual stimulus and then rate how well they saw
  the stimulus. Consistent with previous studies, participants correctly
  discriminated with slightly above chance-level accuracy the location of a
  stimulus they reported not seeing. Signal detection analyses indicated that
  while subjects categorized their percepts as "unconscious," their capacity to
  discriminate these stimuli lay on the same continuum as conscious vision. We
  show that the accuracy of discriminating the location of a subliminal stimulus

  lateralized electroencephalographic (EEG) activity before the stimulus, the
  hemifield where the stimulus was presented, and the accuracy of previous

  Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold
  screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with
  currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of
  mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits,
  novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just
  one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to ?ban? p-values or
  other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures
  should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take
  priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom
  makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely
  statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be
  implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical
  decision making more broadly.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample
  size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later
  contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry
  of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are
  compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published
  meta-analyses. DESIGN: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a
  meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if
  effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within
  30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified
  from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38
  meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of
  Systematic Reviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as
  measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against
  precision. RESULTS: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that
  were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic
  medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were
  four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to
  meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in
  three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14
  (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot
  asymmetry indicated that there was bias. CONCLUSIONS: A simple analysis of
  funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in
  meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when
  meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from
  such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

  and is particularly susceptible to the effects of Alzheimer's disease; and two
  slave systems, namely (ii) the visuospatial sketch pad, which manipulates

  response-bias free measure of how well confidence ratings track task accuracy.
  Here we provide an overview of standard SDT and an extended formal treatment
  of meta-d′. However, whereas meta-d′ characterizes an observer’s sensitivity
  in tracking overall accuracy, it may sometimes be of interest to assess
  metacognition for a particular kind of behavioral response. For instance, in a
  perceptual detection task, we may wish to characterize metacognition
  separately for reports of stimulus presence and absence. Here we discuss the
  methodology for computing such a “response-specific” meta-d′ and provide
  corresponding Matlab code. This approach potentially offers an alternative
  explanation for data that are typically taken to support the unequal variance
  SDT (UV-SDT) model. We demonstrate that simulated data generated from UV-SDT
  can be well fit by an equal variance SDT model positing different
  metacognitive ability for each kind of behavioral response, and likewise that
  data generated by the latter model can be captured by UV-SDT. This ambiguity
  entails that caution is needed in interpreting the processes underlying
  relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve properties. Type 1 ROC curves
  generated by combining type 1 and type 2 judgments, traditionally interpreted
  in terms of low-level processes (UV), can potentially be interpreted in terms
  of high-level processes instead (response-specific metacognition). Similarly,
  differences in area under response-specific type 2 ROC curves may reflect the
  influence of low-level processes (UV) rather than high-level metacognitive
  processes.},

  neurons are mobilized in effortful tasks for which the specialized processors

  discrete though variable spatio-temporal patterns subject to modulation by

  from the corrugator supercilii and zygomatic major and obtained ratings on
  scales of valence and arousal for experienced emotions (Study 1) and for
  experienced and recognized emotions (Study 2) while participants viewed
  dynamic and static facial expressions of negative and positive emotions. Path
  analyses showed that the facial EMG activity consistently predicted the
  valence ratings for the emotions experienced in response to dynamic facial
  expressions. The experienced valence ratings in turn predicted the recognized
  valence ratings in Study 2. Conclusion: These results suggest that facial
  mimicry influences the sharing and recognition of emotional valence in

  on the recognition of and judgments about facial expressions of emotion and to
  evaluate the asymmetry of facial mimicry. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
  Patients with left or right unilateral facial paralysis at a university facial
  plastic surgery unit completed 2 computer tasks involving video facial
  expression recognition. Side of facial paralysis was used as a
  between-participant factor. Facial function and symmetry were verified
  electronically with the eFACE facial function scale. EXPOSURES: Across 2
  tasks, short videos were shown on which facial expressions of happiness and
  anger unfolded earlier on one side of the face or morphed into each other.
  Patients indicated the moment or side of change between facial expressions and
  judged their authenticity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Type, time, and
  accuracy of responses on a keyboard were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 57
  participants (36 women and 21 men) aged 20 to 76 years (mean age, 50.2 years)
  and with mild left or right unilateral facial paralysis were included in the
  study. Patients with right facial paralysis were faster (by about 150
  milliseconds) and more accurate (mean number of errors, 1.9 vs 2.5) to detect
  expression onsets on the left side of the stimulus face, suggesting anatomical
  asymmetry of facial mimicry. Patients with left paralysis, however, showed
  more anomalous responses, which partly differed by emotion. CONCLUSIONS AND
  RELEVANCE: The findings favor the hypothesis of an anatomical asymmetry of
  facial mimicry and suggest that patients with a left hemiparalysis could be
  more at risk of developing a cluster of disabilities and psychological
  conditions including emotion-recognition impairments. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

  abstract = {Purpose Bayesian multilevel models are increasingly used to
  overcome the limitations of frequentist approaches in the analysis of complex
  structured data. This tutorial introduces Bayesian multilevel modeling for the
  specific analysis of speech data, using the brms package developed in R.
  Method In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to Bayesian
  multilevel modeling by reanalyzing a phonetic data set containing formant (F1
  and F2) values for 5 vowels of standard Indonesian (ISO 639-3:ind), as spoken
  by 8 speakers (4 females and 4 males), with several repetitions of each vowel.
  Results We first give an introductory overview of the Bayesian framework and
  multilevel modeling. We then show how Bayesian multilevel models can be fitted
  using the probabilistic programming language Stan and the R package brms,
  which provides an intuitive formula syntax. Conclusions Through this tutorial,
  we demonstrate some of the advantages of the Bayesian framework for
  statistical modeling and provide a detailed case study, with complete source
  code for full reproducibility of the analyses ( https://osf.io/dpzcb /).

  suppression (CFS) has become an immensely popular tool for investigating
  visual processing outside of awareness. The emerging picture from studies
  using CFS is that extensive processing of a visual stimulus, including its
  semantic and affective content, occurs despite suppression from awareness of
  that stimulus by CFS. However, the current implementation of CFS in many
  studies examining processing outside of awareness has several drawbacks that
  may be improved upon for future studies using CFS. In this paper, we address
  some of those shortcomings, particularly ones that affect the assessment of
  unawareness during CFS, and ones to do with the use of "visible" conditions
  that are often included as a comparison to a CFS condition. We also discuss
  potential biases in stimulus processing as a result of spatial attention and
  feature-selective suppression. We suggest practical guidelines that minimize
  the effects of those limitations in using CFS to study visual processing

  Additionally, High-AQ scorers had a relatively larger P3 at the occipital
  region to sad faces. Regardless of the AQ score, subliminal perceived
  emotional faces elicited shorter N1, N2, and P3 latencies than supraliminal
  faces. Happy and sad faces had shorter N170 latency in the supraliminal than

  examine whether the amygdala responds differentially to threatening (fearful)
  versus nonthreatening (happy) facial expressions depending on whether the face
  is attended or actively ignored. In separate runs, participants were cued to
  attend to a face or a house within semitransparent, spatially overlaid
  composite pairs, presented either side of fixation, and were required to
  perform a demanding same/different judgment. We found significant attentional
  modulation of activity in category-specific 'face' (fusiform gyrus) and
  'place' (parahippocampal gyrus) regions, with activity in each area increasing
  selectively when its preferred stimulus was attended versus ignored. In
  contrast, activity in the amygdala differed according to the valence of the
  facial expression and the category of the attended stimulus. For happy faces,
  activity in the amygdala was greater in the attend-face than in the
  attend-house condition, whereas for fearful faces, activity was greater in the
  attend-house than in the attend-face condition. We conclude that differential
  amygdala responses to fearful versus happy facial expressions are tuned by
  mechanisms of attention and that the amygdala gives preference to potentially
  threatening stimuli under conditions of inattention.},

  (fMRI) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings to delineate place-selective
  cortex in a patient implanted with stereo-EEG electrodes for presurgical

  of a cortical area in the collateral sulcus and medial fusiform gyrus, which

  classical model has two main disadvantages. First, the second level of the
  analysis discards information on trial repetitions and subject-specific
  variability. Second, the model does not easily allow assessing the goodness of
  fit. As an alternative to this classical approach, here we propose the
  Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The GLMM separately estimates the
  variability of fixed and random effects, it has a higher statistical power,
  and it allows an easier assessment of the goodness of fit compared with the
  classical two-level model. GLMMs have been frequently used in many disciplines
  since the 1990s; however, they have been rarely applied in psychophysics.
  Furthermore, to our knowledge, the issue of estimating the
  point-of-subjective-equivalence (PSE) within the GLMM framework has never been
  addressed. Therefore the article has two purposes: It provides a brief
  introduction to the usage of the GLMM in psychophysics, and it evaluates two
  different methods to estimate the PSE and its variability within the GLMM
  framework. We compare the performance of the GLMM and the classical two-level
  model on published experimental data and simulated data. We report that the
  estimated values of the parameters were similar between the two models and
  Type I errors were below the confidence level in both models. However, the
  GLMM has a higher statistical power than the two-level model. Moreover, one
  can easily compare the fit of different GLMMs according to different criteria.
  In conclusion, we argue that the GLMM can be a useful method in psychophysics.},

  estimates in psychology are often inaccurate, leads to a practical challenge
  when designing an experiment. This challenge can be addressed by performing
  sequential analyses while the data collection is still in progress. At an
  interim analysis, data collection can be stopped whenever the results are
  convincing enough to conclude that an effect is present, more data can be
  collected, or the study can be terminated whenever it is extremely unlikely
  that the predicted effect will be observed if data collection would be
  continued. Such interim analyses can be performed while controlling the Type 1
  error rate. Sequential analyses can greatly improve the efficiency with which
  data are collected. Additional flexibility is provided by adaptive designs
  where sample sizes are increased on the basis of the observed effect size. The
  need for pre-registration, ways to prevent experimenter bias, and a comparison
  between Bayesian approaches and null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST)
  are discussed. Sequential analyses, which are widely used in large-scale
  medical trials, provide an efficient way to perform high-powered informative
  experiments. I hope this introduction will provide a practical primer that
  allows researchers to incorporate sequential analyses in their research.

  is elicited in the occipitotemporal cortex at ∼170 ms from the onset of
  presentation (N170). Previous studies have shown that the average N170 is
  correlated with conscious face perception; however, the single-trial
  mechanisms underlying such modulation remain largely unexplored. Here, we
  studied in human subjects the average and the single-trial N170 responses to
  briefly flashed faces, coupled with backward masking and varying degrees of
  Gaussian noise. In the average evoked responses we observed that, at fixed
  levels of noise, supraliminal faces exhibited significantly larger N170
  amplitudes than subliminal faces. Moreover, the average N170 amplitude
  decreased with noise level both for the perceived and the nonperceived faces.
  At the single-trial level, the N170 amplitude was modulated by conscious
  recognition, which allowed predicting the subjects' perceptual responses above
  chance. In contrast, the single-trial N170 amplitudes were not modulated by
  the amount of noise and the effect found in the average responses was due to
  different latency jitters, as confirmed with latency-corrected averages.
  Altogether, these results suggest that conscious face perception is correlated
  with a boost in the activity of face-selective neural assemblies, whereas the
  stimulus uncertainty introduced by the added noise decreases the timing
  consistency (but not the amplitude) of this activation.},

  conceptualization and operationalization of exactly what phenomenon is to be
  studied, progress in theory and research is difficult to achieve and fruitless
  debates are likely to proliferate. A particularly unfortunate example is
  William James?s asking the question ?What is an emotion?? when he really meant
  ?feeling?, a misnomer that started a debate which is still ongoing, more than
  a century later. This contribution attempts to sensitize researchers in the
  social and behavioral sciences to the importance of definitional issues and
  their consequences for distinguishing related but fundamentally different
  affective processes, states, and traits. Links between scientific and folk
  concepts of emotion are explored and ways to measure emotion and its
  components are discussed.},

  abstract = {Every day cognitive and experimental researchers attempt to find
  evidence in support of their hypotheses in terms of statistical differences or
  similarities among groups. The most typical cases involve quantifying the
  difference of two samples in terms of their mean values using the t statistic
  or other measures, such as Cohen's d or U metrics. In both cases the aim is to
  quantify how large such differences have to be in order to be classified as
  notable effects. These issues are particularly relevant when dealing with
  experimental and applied psychological research. However, most of these
  standard measures require some distributional assumptions to be correctly
  used, such as symmetry, unimodality, and well-established parametric forms.
  Although these assumptions guarantee that asymptotic properties for inference
  are satisfied, they can often limit the validity and interpretability of
  results. In this article we illustrate the use of a distribution-free
  overlapping measure as an alternative way to quantify sample differences and
  assess research hypotheses expressed in terms of Bayesian evidence. The main
  features and potentials of the overlapping index are illustrated by means of
  three empirical applications. Results suggest that using this index can
  considerably improve the interpretability of data analysis results in
  psychological research, as well as the reliability of conclusions that
  researchers can draw from their studies.},

  abstract = {Researchers designing experiments in which a sample of
  participants responds to a sample of stimuli are faced with difficult
  questions about optimal study design. The conventional procedures of
  statistical power analysis fail to provide appropriate answers to these
  questions because they are based on statistical models in which stimuli are
  not assumed to be a source of random variation in the data, models that are
  inappropriate for experiments involving crossed random factors of participants
  and stimuli. In this article, we present new methods of power analysis for
  designs with crossed random factors, and we give detailed, practical guidance
  to psychology researchers planning experiments in which a sample of
  participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We extensively examine 5
  commonly used experimental designs, describe how to estimate statistical power
  in each, and provide power analysis results based on a reasonable set of
  default parameter values. We then develop general conclusions and formulate
  rules of thumb concerning the optimal design of experiments in which a sample
  of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We show that in crossed
  designs, statistical power typically does not approach unity as the number of
  participants goes to infinity but instead approaches a maximum attainable
  power value that is possibly small, depending on the stimulus sample. We also
  consider the statistical merits of designs involving multiple stimulus blocks.
  Finally, we provide a simple and flexible Web-based power application to aid
  researchers in planning studies with samples of stimuli.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In psychiatric genetics research, the volume of
  ambivalent findings on gene-environment interactions (G x E) is growing at an
  accelerating pace. In response to the surging suspicions of systematic
  distortion, we challenge the notion of chance capitalization as a possible
  contributor. Beyond qualifying multiple testing as a mere methodological issue
  that, if uncorrected, leads to chance capitalization, we advance towards
  illustrating the potential benefits of multiple tests in understanding
  equivocal evidence in genetics literature. METHOD: We focused on the
  interaction between the serotonin-transporter-linked promotor region
  (5-HTTLPR) and childhood adversities with regard to depression. After testing
  2160 interactions with all relevant measures available within the Dutch
  population study of adolescents TRAILS, we calculated percentages of
  significant (p < .05) effects for several subsets of regressions. Using chance
  capitalization (i.e. overall significance rate of 5\% alpha and randomly
  distributed findings) as a competing hypothesis, we expected more significant
  effects in the subsets of regressions involving: 1) interview-based instead of
  questionnaire-based measures; 2) abuse instead of milder childhood
  adversities; and 3) early instead of later adversities. Furthermore, we
  expected equal significance percentages across 4) male and female subsamples,
  and 5) various genotypic models of 5-HTTLPR. RESULTS: We found differences in
  the percentages of significant interactions among the subsets of analyses,
  including those regarding sex-specific subsamples and genetic modeling, but
  often in unexpected directions. Overall, the percentage of significant
  interactions was 7.9\% which is only slightly above the 5\% that might be
  expected based on chance. CONCLUSION: Taken together, multiple testing
  provides a novel approach to better understand equivocal evidence on G x E,
  showing that methodological differences across studies are a likely reason for
  heterogeneity in findings - but chance capitalization is at least equally
  plausible.},

  abstract = {In the social sciences it is common practice to test specific
  theoretically motivated research hypotheses using formal statistical
  procedures. Typically, students in these disciplines are trained in such
  methods starting at an early stage in their academic tenure. On the other
  hand, in psychophysical research, where parameter estimates are generally
  obtained using a maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion and data do not lend
  themselves well to the least-squares methods taught in introductory courses,
  it is relatively uncommon to see formal model comparisons performed. Rather,
  it is common practice to estimate the parameters of interest (e.g., detection
  thresholds) and their standard errors individually across the different
  experimental conditions and to 'eyeball' whether the observed pattern of
  parameter estimates supports or contradicts some proposed hypothesis. We
  believe that this is at least in part due to a lack of training in the proper
  methodology as well as a lack of available software to perform such model
  comparisons when ML estimators are used. We introduce here a relatively new
  toolbox of Matlab routines called Palamedes which allows users to perform
  sophisticated model comparisons. In Palamedes, we implement the
  model-comparison approach to hypothesis testing. This approach allows
  researchers considerable flexibility in targeting specific research
  hypotheses. We discuss in a non-technical manner how this method can be used
  to perform statistical model comparisons when ML estimators are used. With
  Palamedes we hope to make sophisticated statistical model comparisons
  available to researchers who may not have the statistical background or the
  programming skills to perform such model comparisons from scratch. Note that
  while Palamedes is specifically geared toward psychophysical data, the core
  ideas behind the model-comparison approach that our paper discusses generalize
  to any field in which statistical hypotheses are tested.},

  abstract = {Sum-based global tests are highly popular in multiple hypothesis
  testing. In this paper we propose a general closed testing procedure for sum
  tests, which provides lower confidence bounds for the proportion of true
  discoveries (TDP), simultaneously over all subsets of hypotheses. These
  simultaneous inferences come for free, i.e., without any adjustment of the
  alpha-level, whenever a global test is used. Our method allows for an
  exploratory approach, as simultaneity ensures control of the TDP even when the
  subset of interest is selected post hoc. It adapts to the unknown joint
  distribution of the data through permutation testing. Any sum test may be
  employed, depending on the desired power properties. We present an iterative
  shortcut for the closed testing procedure, based on the branch and bound
  algorithm, which converges to the full closed testing results, often after few
  iterations; even if it is stopped early, it controls the TDP. We compare the
  properties of different choices for the sum test through simulations, then we
  illustrate the feasibility of the method for high dimensional data on brain
  imaging and genomics data.},

  explained by typical magnitudes of statistical power, bias or heterogeneity? A
  large survey of 12,065 estimated effect sizes from 200 meta-analyses and
  nearly 8,000 papers is used to assess these key dimensions of replicability.
  First, our survey finds that psychological research is, on average, afflicted
  with low statistical power. The median of median power across these 200 areas
  of research is about 36\%, and only about 8\% of studies have adequate power
  (using Cohen's 80\% convention). Second, the median proportion of the observed
  variation among reported effect sizes attributed to heterogeneity is 74\%
  (I2). Heterogeneity of this magnitude makes it unlikely that the typical
  psychological study can be closely replicated when replication is defined as
  study-level null hypothesis significance testing. Third, the good news is that
  we find only a small amount of average residual reporting bias, allaying some
  of the often-expressed concerns about the reach of publication bias and
  questionable research practices. Nonetheless, the low power and high
  heterogeneity that our survey finds fully explain recent difficulties to
  replicate highly regarded psychological studies and reveal challenges for
  scientific progress in psychology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all

  abstract = {Results from recent event-related brain potential (ERP) studies
  investigating brain processes involved in the detection and analysis of
  emotional facial expression are reviewed. In all experiments, emotional faces
  were found to trigger an increased ERP positivity relative to neutral faces.
  The onset of this emotional expression effect was remarkably early, ranging
  from 120 to 180ms post-stimulus in different experiments where faces were
  either presented at fixation or laterally, and with or without non-face
  distractor stimuli. While broadly distributed positive deflections beyond
  250ms post-stimulus have been found in previous studies for non-face stimuli,
  the early frontocentrally distributed phase of this emotional positivity is
  most likely face-specific. Similar emotional expression effects were found for
  six basic emotions, suggesting that these effects are not primarily generated
  within neural structures specialised for the automatic detection of specific
  emotions. Expression effects were eliminated when attention was directed away
  from the location of peripherally presented emotional faces, indicating that
  they are not linked to pre-attentive emotional processing. When foveal faces
  were unattended, expression effects were attenuated, but not completely
  eliminated. It is suggested that these ERP correlates of emotional face
  processing reflect activity within a neocortical system where representations
  of emotional content are generated in a task-dependent fashion for the
  adaptive intentional control of behaviour. Given the early onset of the
  emotion-specific effects reviewed here, it is likely that this system is
  activated in parallel with the ongoing evaluation of emotional content in the
  amygdala and related subcortical brain circuits.},

  meta-analyses in our literatures shows that replication studies are in fact
  being conducted in most areas of research. Many who argue for replication as
  the “gold standard” consider a non-significant replication attempt to be
  strong evidence against the initial study, an interpretation that ignores
  statistical power, typically low in behavioral research. Many researchers also
  hold that there is no need to replicate a non-significant finding, believing
  it will always replicate perfectly, an erroneous belief. These beliefs lead to
  a widely accepted sequential model of the research process that is deficient
  because it assumes that a single study can answer a research question, a
  belief that meta-analysis has shown to be false. Meta-analysis can provide the
  solution to these problems if the problems of publication bias and
  questionable research practices are successfully addressed. The real problem
  is not a lack of replication; it is the distortion of our research literatures

  to let the user choose the rejected set freely, and to let the multiple
  testing procedure return a confidence statement on the number of false
  rejections incurred. In our approach, such confidence statements are
  simultaneous for all choices of the rejected set, so that post hoc selection
  of the rejected set does not compromise their validity. The proposed reversal
  of roles requires nothing more than a review of the familiar closed testing
  procedure, but with a focus on the non-consonant rejections that this
  procedure makes. We suggest several shortcuts to avoid the computational
  problems associated with closed testing.},

  these stores can be temporarily maintained via focused attention termed
  ‘refreshing’, while the phonological loop can also maintain familiar
  verbalizable material by subvocal or overt rehearsal. Both subsystems are
  controlled by a third component, the central executive, a supervisory system
  with limited resources. The central executive is principally concerned with
  internally directed attentional control processes but also has a role in the
  attentional selection of perceptual information. Information from these three
  components is coordinated with information from perception and long-term
  memory through the fourth component, a multidimensional, multimodal episodic
  buffer. This component is capable of holding up to around four episodic
  chunks, and is a valuable but essentially passive storage system, controlled
  by the central executive and accessible to conscious awareness. The
  multicomponent model has been systematically developed using a number of

  the type of coding involved, concurrent task methods to assess the
  contributions of the various subsystems to complex tasks, and
  neuropsychological evidence, in particular from the study of single cases with

  of research. In this paper we present the current revision of the
  multi-component model that encompasses a central executive, two unimodal
  storage systems: a phonological loop and a visuospatial sketchpad, and a
  further component, a multimodal store capable of integrating information into
  unitary episodic representations, termed episodic buffer. We review recent

  development of the multicomponent model and the understanding of the
  capacities and properties of working memory. Research based largely on
  dual-task experimental designs and on neuropsychological evidence has yielded
  valuable information about the fractionation of working memory into
  independent stores and processes, the nature of representations in individual
  stores, the mechanisms of their maintenance and manipulation, the way the
  components of working memory relate to each other, and the role they play in

  articulatory loop (by preventing subvocal rehearsal) had no effect on measures

  keypad) and blocking the central executive (by random letter generation) had
  equivalent disruptive effects, in comparison with a control condition.
  Experiment 2 investigated the effects of similar secondary tasks on the
  solution (i.e., move selection) of tactical chess positions, and a similar
  pattern was found, except that blocking the central executive was much more
  disruptive than in Experiment 1. Experiment 3 compared performance on two
  types of primary task, one concerned with solving chess positions as in
  Experiment 2, and the other a sentence-rearrangement task. The secondary tasks
  in each case were both designed to block the central executive, but one was
  verbal (vocal generation of random numbers), while the other was spatial in
  nature (random generation of keypresses). Performance of the spatial secondary
  task was affected to a greater extent by the chess primary task than by the
  verbal primary task, whereas there were no differential effects on these
  secondary tasks by the verbal primary task. In none of the three experiments

  abstract = {Is forgetting from working memory (WM) better explained by decay
  or interference? The answer to this question is the topic of an ongoing
  debate. Recently, a number of studies showed that performance in tests of
  visual WM declines with an increasing unfilled retention interval. This
  finding was interpreted as revealing decay. Alternatively, it can be explained
  by interference theories as an effect of temporal distinctiveness. According
  to decay theories, forgetting depends on the absolute time elapsed since the
  event to be retrieved. In contrast, temporal distinctiveness theories predict
  that memory depends on relative time, that is, the time since the
  to-be-retrieved event relative to the time since other, potentially
  interfering events. In the present study, we contrasted the effects of
  absolute time and relative time on forgetting from visual WM, using a
  continuous color recall task. To this end, we varied the retention interval
  and the inter-trial interval. The error in reporting the target color was a

  Variants of this question have preoccupied researchers in a wide range of
  domains, from mainstream experimental psychology (cognition, perception,
  social behavior) to cognitive neuroscience and behavioral economics. A
  pervasive view places a heavy explanatory burden on an intelligent cognitive
  unconscious, with many theories assigning causally effective roles to
  unconscious influences. This article presents a novel framework for evaluating
  these claims and reviews evidence from three major bodies of research in which
  unconscious factors have been studied: multiple-cue judgment, deliberation
  without attention, and decisions under uncertainty. Studies of priming
  (subliminal and primes-to-behavior) and the role of awareness in movement and
  perception (e.g., timing of willed actions, blindsight) are also given brief
  consideration. The review highlights that inadequate procedures for assessing
  awareness, failures to consider artifactual explanations of "landmark"
  results, and a tendency to uncritically accept conclusions that fit with our
  intuitions have all contributed to unconscious influences being ascribed
  inflated and erroneous explanatory power in theories of decision making. The
  review concludes by recommending that future research should focus on tasks in
  which participants' attention is diverted away from the experimenter's
  hypothesis, rather than the highly reflective tasks that are currently often
  employed.},

  evidence for nonconscious affective processing, there are also studies
  reporting their absence. Several methodological variations may give rise to
  this discrepancy: with respect to the experimental paradigm these variations
  pertain to the likelihood of residual stimulus visibility on the level of
  individual participants and single trials. Concerning the statistical analysis
  they relate to the procedures applied to assess whether detection performance
  is at chance level and whether the outcome measure does or does not depend on
  the affective stimulus category. In the present study we determined individual
  eye dominance and individual stimulus contrast in pretests, measured objective
  and subjective awareness online and applied Bayesian statistics to estimate
  the likelihood for the null hypothesis. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were
  measured while participants were subjected to fearful, happy, and neutral

  the absence of nonconscious affective processing under the tested conditions

  N170 to faces showed a strong modulation by emotional facial expression. A
  split half analysis demonstrates that this effect was significant both early
  and late in the experiment and was therefore not associated with only the
  initial exposures of these stimuli, demonstrating a form of robustness against
  habituation. The effect of emotional modulation of the N170 to faces did not
  show significant interaction with the gender of the face stimulus, or
  hemisphere of recording sites. Subtracting the fear versus neutral topography
  provided a topography that itself was highly similar to the face N170.
  CONCLUSION: The face N170 response can be influenced by emotional expressions
  contained within facial stimuli. The topography of this effect is consistent
  with the notion that fear stimuli exaggerates the N170 response itself. This
  finding stands in contrast to previous models suggesting that N170 processes
  linked to structural analysis of faces precede analysis of emotional
  expression, and instead may reflect early top-down modulation from neural
  systems involved in rapid emotional processing.},

  also of reports of conscious contents that are randomly sampled during

  mechanisms; and we review behavioural and electrophysiological data in light
  of the various resulting model versions. We also highlight that filtering is
  better understood as coordinated brain network activity, rather than being the
  function of a single region. Broadcasting of control signals from prefrontal
  cortex appears critical in upholding information in posterior cortical areas
  in the absence of distractors. The very same ability might also support
  selective processing of relevant information in the presence of distractors.
  These ideas provide a novel explanation for the relation between filtering

  few hundred milliseconds later, of its registration at conscious or

  exogenous mode of response inhibition appears to be mediated by corticostriate

  FM and WM in humans are supported by dissociable time-frequency features of

  from which individual differences in FM and WM capacity were estimated. These
  individual FM and WM capacities were correlated with time-frequency
  characteristics of the EEG signal before and during encoding and maintenance
  of the memory display. FM capacity showed negative alpha correlations over
  peri-occipital electrodes, whereas WM capacity was positively related,
  suggesting increased visual processing (lower alpha) to be related to FM
  capacity. Furthermore, FM capacity correlated with an increase in theta power
  over central electrodes during preparation and processing of the memory
  display, whereas WM did not. In addition to a difference in visual processing
  characteristics, a positive relation between gamma power and FM capacity was
  observed during both preparation and maintenance periods of the task. On the
  other hand, we observed that theta-gamma coupling was negatively correlated
  with FM capacity, whereas it was slightly positively correlated with WM. These
  data show clear differences in the neural substrates of FM versus WM and
  suggest that FM depends more on visual processing mechanisms compared with WM.

  fully non-invasive and relatively cheap, (3) they can be recorded continuously

  with patients, (4) and they can be used to enrich patients' autonomy through
  brain-computer interfaces. We recently designed an original auditory rule
  extraction ERP test that evaluates cerebral responses to violations of
  temporal regularities that are either local in time or global across several
  seconds. Local violations led to an early response in auditory cortex,
  independent of attention or the presence of a concurrent visual task, while
  global violations led to a late and spatially distributed response that was
  only present when subjects were attentive and aware of the violations. In the

  potentials, with preserved face-specific negative potentials at 170 ms. When
  left faces were perceived, the same stimuli produced greater activity in a
  distributed network of areas including right V1 and cuneus, bilateral fusiform
  gyri, and left parietal cortex. Also, effective connectivity between visual,
  parietal, and frontal areas increased during perception of faces. These
  results suggest that activity can occur in V1 and ventral temporal cortex

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consciousness poses two main problems. The first is
  understanding the conditions that determine to what extent a system has
  conscious experience. For instance, why is our consciousness generated by
  certain parts of our brain, such as the thalamocortical system, and not by
  other parts, such as the cerebellum? And why are we conscious during
  wakefulness and much less so during dreamless sleep? The second problem is
  understanding the conditions that determine what kind of consciousness a
  system has. For example, why do specific parts of the brain contribute
  specific qualities to our conscious experience, such as vision and audition?
  PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: This paper presents a theory about what
  consciousness is and how it can be measured. According to the theory,
  consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate
  information. This claim is motivated by two key phenomenological properties of
  consciousness: differentiation - the availability of a very large number of
  conscious experiences; and integration - the unity of each such experience.
  The theory states that the quantity of consciousness available to a system can
  be measured as the Phi value of a complex of elements. Phi is the amount of
  causally effective information that can be integrated across the informational
  weakest link of a subset of elements. A complex is a subset of elements with
  Phi>0 that is not part of a subset of higher Phi. The theory also claims that
  the quality of consciousness is determined by the informational relationships
  among the elements of a complex, which are specified by the values of
  effective information among them. Finally, each particular conscious
  experience is specified by the value, at any given time, of the variables
  mediating informational interactions among the elements of a complex. TESTING
  THE HYPOTHESIS: The information integration theory accounts, in a principled
  manner, for several neurobiological observations concerning consciousness. As
  shown here, these include the association of consciousness with certain neural
  systems rather than with others; the fact that neural processes underlying
  consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural processes that remain
  unconscious; the reduction of consciousness during dreamless sleep and
  generalized seizures; and the time requirements on neural interactions that
  support consciousness. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The theory entails that
  consciousness is a fundamental quantity, that it is graded, that it is present
  in infants and animals, and that it should be possible to build conscious
  artifacts.},

  the neural basis of consciousness. For that purpose, we review and compare the
  various neural signs, measures, and mechanisms proposed in the different
  theories. We demonstrate that different theories focus on neural signs and
  measures of distinct aspects of neural activity including stimulus-related,
  prestimulus, and resting state activity as well as on distinct features of
  consciousness. Therefore, the various mechanisms proposed in the different
  theories may, in part, complement each other. Together, we provide insight
  into the shared basis and convergences (and, in part, discrepancies) of the
  different theories of consciousness. We conclude that the different theories

  we suppose, may be integrated and nested within the brain's overall

  conscious and non-conscious perception of emotions in normal observers.
  Fearful and happy facial expressions were presented either unilaterally (to
  the left or right visual field) or simultaneously to both visual fields. In
  bilateral displays, conscious perception of one face in a pair was prevented
  by backward masking after 20 ms, while the opposite expression remained

  non-conscious fear processing over conscious recognition of happy as well as
  fearful expressions. Consciously perceived fearful faces were more readily
  recognized when they were paired with invisible emotionally congruent fearful
  expressions in the opposite field, as compared to the single presentation of
  the same unmasked faces. On the other hand, recognition of unmasked happy
  faces was delayed by the simultaneous presence of a masked fearful face. No
  such effect was reported for masked happy expressions. These findings show

  absent from the ERPs elicited by other animate and inanimate nonface stimuli.
  N170 was largest over the posterior temporal scalp and was larger over the

  eyes elicited an N170 that was significantly larger than that elicited by

  components were altered, elicited an N170 similar in amplitude to that
  elicited by normal faces. However, faces of animals, human hands, cars, and
  items of furniture did not evoke N170. N170 may reflect the operation of a
  neural mechanism tuned to detect (as opposed to identify) human faces, similar
  to the "structural encoder" suggested by Bruce and Young (1986). A similar
  function has been proposed for the face-selective N200 ERP recorded from the

  differential sensitivity of N170 to eyes in isolation suggests that N170 may
  reflect the activation of an eye-sensitive region of cortex. The voltage
  distribution of N170 over the scalp is consistent with a neural generator
  located in the occipitotemporal sulcus lateral to the fusiform/inferior
  temporal region that generates N200.},

  C.D., Downing, P., Pegna, A.J. 2007. Controlling for interstimulus perceptual
  variance abolishes N170 face selectivity. Nature Neuroscience, 10, 505-11)
  claimed that the larger occipito-temporal N170 response to pictures of faces
  than other categories -- the N170 effect -- is due to a methodological
  artifact in stimulus selection, specifically, a greater interstimulus physical
  variance between pictures of objects than faces in previous ERP studies which,
  when controlled, eliminates this N170 effect. This statement casts doubts on
  the validity of the conclusions reached by a whole tradition of
  electrophysiological experiments published over the past 15 years and
  questions the very interest of using the N170 to probe the time course of face
  processes in the human brain. Here we claim that this physical variance factor
  is ill-defined by Thierry et al. and cannot account for previous observations
  of a smaller N170 amplitude to nonface objects than faces without latency
  increase and component "smearing". Most importantly, this factor was
  controlled in previous studies that reported robust N170 effects. We
  demonstrate that the absence of N170 effect in the study of Thierry et al. is
  due to methodological flaws in the reported experiments, most notably
  measuring the N170 at the wrong electrode sites. Moreover, the authors
  attributed a modulation of N170 amplitude in their study to a differential
  interstimulus physical variance while it probably reflects a biased comparison
  of different quality sets of individual images. Here, by taking Thierry et
  al.'s study as an exemplar case of what should not be done in ERP research of
  visual categorization processes, we provide clarifications on a number of
  methodological and theoretical issues about the N170 and its largest amplitude
  to faces. More generally, we discuss the potential role of differential visual
  homogeneity of object categories as well as low-level visual properties versus
  high-level visual processes in accounting for early face-preferential
  responses and the question of the speed at which visual stimuli are

  closely with perceptual awareness. The current study capitalized on a recently
  developed method for manipulating attention and conscious perception during
  EEG recording (modified inattentional blindness paradigm) and used face
  stimuli that elicit a well known marker of early face processing, the N170
  event-related potential (ERP). In Phase 1 of the experiment, subjects
  performed a demanding distracter task while line drawings of faces and matched
  control stimuli were presented in the center of their view. When queried, half
  of the subjects reported no awareness of the faces and were deemed
  inattentionally blind. In Phase 2, subjects performed the same distracter
  task, but now consciously perceived the face stimuli due to the intervening
  questioning. In Phase 3, subjects performed a discrimination task on the
  faces. Two primary contrasts were made: aware versus unaware (equally task
  irrelevant) and task-relevant versus task-irrelevant (equally aware). The N170
  and a subsequent ERP component, the visual awareness negativity (∼ 260-300

  oddball sequence of geometrical shapes presented to male and female human
  participants. Electrophysiological responses were obtained in three physically
  identical Phases A-C that differed only with respect to the instructions: (A)
  participants were uninformed about the shapes and attended an unrelated
  foreground task (inattentional blind), (B) were informed about the shapes but
  still attended the foreground task, and (C) attended the shapes. Conscious
  processing of shapes was indexed by the visual awareness negativity but not a
  P3. Deviance processing was associated with the visual mismatch negativity
  independently of consciousness and task relevance. The oddball P3, however,
  only emerged when the stimuli were task relevant, and was absent for
  consciously perceived but task irrelevant stimuli. The P3 thus does not
  represent a reliable marker of stimulus awareness. This result pattern
  supports the view of hierarchical predictive processing, where lower levels
  display automatic deviance processing, whereas higher levels require attention
  and task relevance.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT To react to potentially important
  changes in our environment it is fundamental to detect deviations from
  regularities of sensory input. It has yet to be understood how awareness and
  task relevance of this input interact with deviance processing. We
  investigated the role of awareness in deviance detection while at the same
  time circumventing the confound of awareness and report by means of a
  no-report paradigm. Our results suggest that early processes are elicited

  modality, it has recently been shown that awareness is often confounded with
  reporting it, possibly overestimating the NCC. It is unknown whether similar
  constraints also exist in the auditory modality. In order to address this gap,
  we presented spoken words in a sustained inattentional deafness paradigm.
  Electrophysiological responses were obtained in three physically identical
  experimental conditions that differed only with respect to the participants'
  instructions. Participants were either left uninformed or informed about the
  presence of spoken words while confronted with an auditory distractor task
  (U/I condition), informed about the words while exposed to the same task as
  before (I condition), or requested to respond to the now task-relevant speech
  stimuli (TR condition). After completion of the U/I condition, only informed
  participants reported awareness of the words. In ERPs, awareness of words in
  the U/I and I condition was accompanied by an anterior auditory awareness
  negativity (AAN). Only when stimuli were task-relevant, i.e., during the TR
  condition, late positivities emerged. Taken together, these results indicate
  that early negativities but not late positivities index awareness across

  researchers often compare the differences in neural activation between
  conditions in which an observer is or is not aware of a stimulus. While
  intuitive, this approach often contains a critical limitation: to link brain
  activity with perceptual awareness, observers traditionally report the
  contents of their perceptual experience. However, relying on observers'
  reports is problematic because it is difficult to know whether the neural
  responses being measured are associated with conscious perception or with
  postperceptual processes involved in the reporting task (e.g., working memory,
  decision-making). To address this issue, we combined a standard visual masking
  paradigm with a recently developed "no-report" paradigm in male/female human
  participants. In the visual masking paradigm, observers saw images of animals
  and objects that were visible or invisible, depending on their proximity to
  masks. Meanwhile, on half of the trials, observers reported the contents of
  their perceptual experience (i.e., report condition), while on the other half
  of trials they refrained from reporting about their experiences (i.e.,
  no-report condition). We used electroencephalography to examine how visibility
  interacts with reporting by measuring the P3b event-related potential, one of
  the proposed canonical "signatures" of conscious processing. Overall, we found
  a robust P3b in the report condition, but no P3b whatsoever in the no-report
  condition. This finding suggests that the P3b itself is not a neural signature
  of conscious processing and highlights the importance of carefully
  distinguishing the neural correlates of perceptual awareness from
  postperceptual processing.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT What are the neural
  signatures that differentiate conscious and unconscious processing in the
  brain? Perhaps the most well established candidate signature is the P3b
  event-related potential, a late slow wave that appears when observers are
  aware of a stimulus, but disappears when a stimulus fails to reach awareness.
  Here, however, we found that the P3b does not track what observers are
  perceiving, but instead tracks what observers are reporting. When observers
  are aware of simple visual stimuli, the P3b is nowhere to be found unless
  observers are reporting the contents of their experience. These results
  challenge the well established notion of the P3b as a neural marker of
  awareness and highlight the need for new approaches to the neuroscience of

  studied in experimental investigations of single patients, as very few
  patients have been given this "diagnosis". In our single case study of patient
  GR, we ask whether blindsight is best described as unconscious vision, or
  rather as conscious, yet severely degraded vision. In experiment 1 and 2, we
  successfully replicate the typical findings of previous studies on blindsight.
  The third experiment, however, suggests that GR's ability to discriminate
  amongst visual stimuli does not reflect unconscious vision, but rather
  degraded, yet conscious vision. As our finding results from using a method for
  obtaining subjective reports that has not previously used in blindsight
  studies (but validated in studies of healthy subjects and other patients with
  brain injury), our results call for a reconsideration of blindsight, and,
  arguably also of many previous studies of unconscious perception in healthy
  subjects.},

  reports consistently showed that event-related potentials (ERPs) measured over

  stimuli at 80-100 ms after stimulus onset. So far, however, all previous
  studies have operationalized somatosensory awareness as binary stimulus
  detection. Here, we investigated whether ERP components attributed to neuronal
  activity in early somatosensory cortices would parametrically reflect
  subjective ratings of stimulus awareness. EEG (64 channel) was recorded in
  human participants (N = 20), with perithreshold electrical stimulation applied
  to the left median nerve. Participants indicated perceptibility on a
  continuous visual rating scale, and stimulation intensity was readjusted in
  each block to a perithreshold level. The aim of the analysis was to
  investigate which brain areas reflect the subsequent perceptual awareness
  ratings parametrically, and how early such parametric effects occur.
  Parametric ERP effects were found as early as 86 ms after stimulus onset. This
  parametric modulation of ERP amplitude was source localized to secondary
  somatosensory cortex, and attributed to feedforward processing between primary
  and secondary somatosensory cortex by means of dynamic causal modeling (DCM).
  Furthermore, later in the analysis window, the subjective rating of stimuli
  correlated with the amplitude of the N140 component and with a broadly
  distributed P300 component. By DCM modeling, these late effects were explained
  in terms of recurrent processing within the network of somatosensory and
  premotor cortices. Our results indicate that early neural activity in the
  somatosensory cortex can reflect the subjective quality of tactile perception.},

  We recorded magnetoencephalographic signals while human subjects attended
  toward or away from faint stimuli that were reported as consciously seen only
  half of the time. Visually identical stimuli could thus be attended or not and
  consciously seen or not. Although attended stimuli were consciously seen
  slightly more often than unattended ones, the factorial analysis of
  stimulus-induced oscillatory brain activity revealed distinct and independent
  neural correlates of visual awareness and spatial attention at different
  frequencies in the gamma range (30-150 Hz). Whether attended or not,
  consciously seen stimuli induced increased mid-frequency gamma-band activity
  over the contralateral visual cortex, whereas spatial attention modulated
  high-frequency gamma-band activity in response to both consciously seen and
  unseen stimuli. A parametric analysis of the data at the single-trial level
  confirmed that the awareness-related mid-frequency activity drove the
  seen-unseen decision but also revealed a small influence of the
  attention-related high-frequency activity on the decision. These results

  Marinkovic (1995) model to examine these processes using event-related

  with fear and neutral (as baseline control) expressions, presented above

  ERP data revealed a double dissociation for the supraliminal versus subliminal

  of fear stimuli were enhanced relative to neutral for the N2 "excitatory"
  component, which is thought to represent orienting and automatic aspects of

  against a unified, distributed fronto-parietal correlate of consciousness.
  Instead, it suggests that correlates of consciousness are divided into primary

  hard problem' of consciousness in the philosophy of mind. However, a separate
  hard problem faces the scientific study of consciousness. The problem arises
  when distinguishing the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) and the
  neural constitution of consciousness. Here, I explain this
  correlation/constitution distinction and the problem it poses for a science of
  phenomenal consciousness. I also discuss potential objections to the problem,
  outline further hard problems in the scientific study of phenomenal
  consciousness and consider the ontological implications of these
  epistemological issues. METHODS: Scientific and philosophic analysis and
  discussion are presented. RESULTS: The correlation/constitution distinction
  does indeed present a hard problem in the scientific study of phenomenal
  consciousness. Refinement of the 'NCC' acronym is proposed so that this
  distinction may at least be acknowledged in the literature. Furthermore, in
  addition to the problem posed by this distinction and to 'the hard problem',
  the scientific study of phenomenal consciousness also faces several other hard
  problems. CONCLUSION: In light of the multiple hard problems, it is concluded
  that scientists and philosophers of consciousness ought to (i) address,
  analyze and discuss the problems in the hope of discovering their solution or
  dissolution and (ii) consider the implications of some or all of them being
  intractable. With respect to the latter, it is argued that ultimate epistemic
  limits in the study of phenomenal consciousness pose no threat to physicalist
  or materialist ontologies but do inform our understanding of consciousness and
  its place in nature.},

  emerges also relatively independent of manipulations of nonspatial attention,

  Recall precision was accurately described by the interaction of two
  independent constraints: an encoding limit that determines the maximum rate at
  which information can be transferred into memory and a separate storage limit
  that determines the maximum fidelity with which information can be maintained.
  Recall variability decreased incrementally with time, consistent with a
  parallel encoding process in which visual information from multiple objects
  accumulates simultaneously in working memory. No evidence was observed for a
  limit on the number of items stored. Cuing one display item with a brief flash
  led to rapid development of a recall advantage for that item. This advantage
  was short-lived if the cue was simply a salient visual event but was
  maintained if it indicated an object of particular relevance to the task.
  These cuing effects were observed even for items that had already been encoded

  age 58 years; 57\% women) across major tumor entities, enrolled in an
  epidemiological multicenter study. To identify distress-related problems, we
  conducted monothetic analyses. RESULTS: We found high levels of psychological
  distress (DT ≥ 5) in 52\% of patients. The most prevalent problems were
  fatigue (56\%), sleep problems (51\%), and problems getting around (47\%).
  Sadness, fatigue, and sleep problems were most strongly associated with the
  presence of other problems. High distress was present in 81.4\% of patients
  reporting all 3 of these problems (DT M = 6.4). When analyzing only the subset
  of physical problems, fatigue, problems getting around, and indigestion showed
  the strongest association with the remaining problems and 76.3\% of patients

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advantages of meta-analysis depend on the assumptions
  underlying the statistical procedures used being met. One of the main
  assumptions that is usually taken for granted is the normality underlying the
  population of true effects in a random-effects model, even though the
  available evidence suggests that this assumption is often not met. This paper
  examines how 21 frequentist and 24 Bayesian methods, including several novel
  procedures, for computing a point estimate of the heterogeneity parameter
  ([Formula: see text]) perform when the distribution of random effects departs
  from normality compared to normal scenarios in meta-analysis of standardized
  mean differences. METHODS: A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out using the
  R software, generating data for meta-analyses using the standardized mean
  difference. The simulation factors were the number and average sample size of
  primary studies, the amount of heterogeneity, as well as the shape of the
  random-effects distribution. The point estimators were compared in terms of
  absolute bias and variance, although results regarding mean squared error were
  also discussed. RESULTS: Although not all the estimators were affected to the
  same extent, there was a general tendency to obtain lower and more variable
  [Formula: see text] estimates as the random-effects distribution departed from
  normality. However, the estimators ranking in terms of their absolute bias and
  variance did not change: Those estimators that obtained lower bias also showed
  greater variance. Finally, a large number and sample size of primary studies
  acted as a bias-protective factor against a lack of normality for several
  procedures, whereas only a high number of studies was a variance-protective
  factor for most of the estimators analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Although the
  estimation and inference of the combined effect have proven to be sufficiently
  robust, our work highlights the role that the deviation from normality may be
  playing in the meta-analytic conclusions from the simulation results and the
  numerical examples included in this work. With the aim to exercise caution in
  the interpretation of the results obtained from random-effects models, the
  tau2() R function is made available for obtaining the range of [Formula: see
  text] values computed from the 45 estimators analyzed in this work, as well as
  to assess how the pooled effect, its confidence and prediction intervals vary

  However, the inclusion of the between-study variance in the random-effects
  model, and the need to estimate this parameter, can have unfortunate
  implications for this power. We develop methods for assessing the power of
  random-effects meta-analyses, and the average power of the individual studies
  that contribute to meta-analyses, so that these powers can be compared. In
  addition to deriving new analytical results and methods, we apply our methods
  to 1991 meta-analyses taken from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
  to retrospectively calculate their powers. We find that, in practice, 5 or
  more studies are needed to reasonably consistently achieve powers from
  random-effects meta-analyses that are greater than the studies that contribute
  to them. Not only is statistical inference under the random-effects model
  challenging when there are very few studies but also less worthwhile in such
  cases. The assumption that meta-analysis will result in an increase in power

  of newly developed meta-analysis methods. For methodology that is developed
  for an aggregated data meta-analysis, researchers often resort to simulation
  of the aggregated data directly, instead of simulating individual participant
  data from which the aggregated data would be calculated in reality. Clearly,
  distributional characteristics of the aggregated data statistics may be
  derived from distributional assumptions of the underlying individual data, but
  they are often not made explicit in publications. This paper provides the
  distribution of the aggregated data statistics that were derived from a
  heteroscedastic mixed effects model for continuous individual data. As a
  result, we provide a procedure for directly simulating the aggregated data

  approaches of aggregated data used in literature by describing their
  theoretical differences and by conducting a simulation study for three
  meta-analysis methods: DerSimonian and Laird's pooled estimate and the Trim \&
  Fill and PET-PEESE method for adjustment of publication bias. We demonstrate
  that the choices of simulation model for aggregated data may have a relevant
  impact on (the conclusions of) the performance of the meta-analysis method. We
  recommend the use of multiple aggregated data simulation models for
  investigation of new methodology to determine sensitivity or otherwise make

  curriculum in elementary, secondary, and post-secondary education. Because of
  this growing movement to expand and include statistics into all levels of
  education, there is also a considerable interest in employing effective
  instructional methods, especially for statistics concepts that tend to be very
  difficult or abstract. Researchers have recommended using computer simulation
  methods (CSMs) to teach these concepts; however, a review of the literature
  reveals very little empirical research to support the recommendations. The
  purpose of this paper is to summarize and critically evaluate the literature
  on how CSMs are used in the statistics classroom and their potential impact on
  student achievement. The recommendation is that more empirically and
  theoretically grounded research studies are needed to determine if these
  methods improve student learning.},

  example, 440 participants (69\%) found U3 more informative than Cohen's d,

  Forty-two participants were required to discriminate facial expressions of the

  participants. The ANOVA analyses showed that the facial expression,
  hemisphere, and presentation duration affected the grand-mean ERP (N1, P1, and
  N170) and ERO (below 20 Hz and lasted from 100 ms to 250 ms post-stimulus,
  mainly in theta band) brain activity. More importantly, the overall detection
  ability of 42 subjects was significantly correlated with the emotion effect
  (i.e., fearful vs. neutral) on ERP (r = 0.403) and ERO (r = 0.552)
  measurements. A higher d' value was corresponding to a larger size of the
  emotional effect (i.e., fearful--neutral) of N170 amplitude and a larger size
  of the emotional effect of the specific ERO spectral power at the right
  hemisphere. The present results suggested a close link between behavioral
  detection ability and the N170 amplitude as well as the ERO spectral power
  below 20 Hz in individuals. The emotional effect size between fearful and

  size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later
  contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry
  of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are
  compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published
  meta-analyses. DESIGN: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a
  meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if
  effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within
  30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified
  from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38
  meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of
  Systematic Reviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as
  measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against
  precision. RESULTS: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that
  were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic
  medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were
  four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to
  meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in
  three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14
  (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot
  asymmetry indicated that there was bias. CONCLUSIONS: A simple analysis of
  funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in
  meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when
  meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from
  such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

  Generalized linear models (GLMs) are powerful tools in applied statistics that
  extend the ideas of multiple linear regression and analysis of variance to
  include response variables that are not normally distributed. As such, GLMs
  can model a wide variety of data types including counts, proportions, and
  binary outcomes or positive quantities.The book is designed with the student
  in mind, making it suitable for self-study or a structured course. Beginning
  with an introduction to linear regression, the book also devotes time to
  advanced topics not typically included in introductory textbooks. It features
  chapter introductions and summaries, clear examples, and many practice
  problems, all carefully designed to balance theory and practice. The text also
  provides a working knowledge of applied statistical practice through the
  extensive use of R, which is integrated into the text. Other features include:
  • Advanced topics such as power variance functions, saddlepoint
  approximations, likelihood score tests, modified profile likelihood,
  small-dispersion asymptotics, and randomized quantile residuals • Nearly 100
  data sets in the companion R package GLMsData • Examples that are

  estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences
  occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean
  while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the
  mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively
  weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the
  variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted
  differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an
  example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are
  affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present
  results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating
  abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial
  regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the
  different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of
  weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

  a key issue in meta-analyses of observational studies, since it is critical

  decision criterion. In this paper, the authors use a large simulation study
  patterned from the key features of five published epidemiologic meta-analyses
  to investigate the type I error and statistical power of five previously
  proposed asymptotic homogeneity tests, a parametric bootstrap version of each
  of the tests, and tau2-bootstrap, a test proposed by the authors. The results

  inefficiently encode and maintain information about the irrelevant items
  present in the display. These results provide evidence that under many

  abstract = {Inhibitory response control has been extensively investigated in
  both electrophysiological (ERP) and hemodynamic (fMRI) studies. However, very
  few multimodal results address the coupling of these inhibition markers. In
  fMRI, response inhibition has been most consistently linked to activation of
  the anterior insula and inferior frontal cortex (IFC), often also the anterior
  cingulate cortex (ACC). ERP work has established increased N2 and P3
  amplitudes during NoGo compared to Go conditions in most studies. Previous
  simultaneous EEG-fMRI imaging reported association of the N2/P3 complex with
  activation of areas like the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) and anterior
  insula. In this study we investigated inhibitory control in 23 healthy young
  adults (mean age=24.7, n=17 for EEG during fMRI) using a combined Flanker/NoGo
  task during simultaneous EEG and fMRI recording. Separate fMRI and ERP
  analysis yielded higher activation in the anterior insula, IFG and ACC as well
  as increased N2 and P3 amplitudes during NoGo trials in accordance with the
  literature. Combined analysis modelling sequential N2 and P3 effects through
  joint parametric modulation revealed correlation of higher N2 amplitude with
  deactivation in parts of the default mode network (DMN) and the cingulate
  motor area (CMA) as well as correlation of higher central P3 amplitude with
  activation of the left anterior insula, IFG and posterior cingulate. The
  EEG-fMRI results resolve the localizations of these sequential activations.
  They suggest a general role for allocation of attentional resources and motor
  inhibition for N2 and link memory recollection and internal reflection to P3
  amplitude, in addition to previously described response inhibition as
  reflected by the anterior insula.},

  we present a theoretical framework that elucidates hippocampal contributions
  to scalp P300 based on intracranial and lesion research combined with emerging
  evidence on the role of the hippocampus in rapid statistical learning, memory,
  and novelty processing. The P300 has been divided in two subcomponents: a
  fronto-central P3a related to novelty and distractor processing, and a
  parietal P3b related to target detection. Interest in a role for hippocampus
  in scalp P300 was sparked by P3-like ERPs measured intracranially in human
  hippocampus. Subsequent medial temporal lobe lesion studies show intact scalp
  P3b, indicating that the hippocampus is not critical for P3b. This contrasts
  with the scalp P3a, which was significantly diminished in human patients with
  lesions in the posterior hippocampus. This suggests a differential role for
  hippocampus in P3a and P3b. Our framework purports that the hippocampus plays
  a central role in distractor processing that leads to P3a generation in
  cortical regions. We also propose that the hippocampus is involved at the end
  of the cognitive episode for both P3a and P3b implementing contextual
  updating. P3-like ERPs measured in hippocampus may reflect input signals from
  cortical regions implementing updates based on the outcome of cognitive
  processes underlying scalp P3, enabling a model update of the environment
  facilitated by the hippocampus. Overall, this framework proposes an active
  role for the hippocampus in novelty processing leading up to P3a generation,
  followed by contextual updating of the outcome of both scalp P3a and P3b.},

  disorder. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that
  the overall average effect size for treatment efficacy was modest, with a mean
  standardized difference of 0.38. Small true effects, combined with the
  difficulty to recruit large samples, seriously challenge researchers planning
  to test treatment efficacy in dyslexia and potentially in other learning
  disorders. Nonetheless, most published studies claim effectiveness, generally
  based on liberal use of multiple testing. This inflates the risk that most
  statistically significant results are associated with overestimated effect
  sizes. To enhance power, we propose the strategic use of repeated measurements
  with mixed-effects modelling. This novel approach would enable us to estimate
  both individual parameters and population-level effects more reliably. We
  suggest assessing a reading outcome not once, but three times, at
  pre-treatment and three times at post-treatment. Such design would require
  only modest additional efforts compared to current practices. Based on this,
  we performed ad hoc a priori design analyses via simulation studies. Results
  showed that using the novel design may allow one to reach adequate power even
  with low sample sizes of 30-40 participants (i.e., 15-20 participants per
  group) for a typical effect size of d = 0.38. Nonetheless, more conservative
  assumptions are warranted for various reasons, including a high risk of
  publication bias in the extant literature. Our considerations can be extended
  to intervention studies of other types of neurodevelopmental disorders.},

  models (also known as multilevel models) can be complicated by heterogeneity
  stemming from random effects and residuals. When heterogeneity is present,
  tests of fixed effects (including cross-level interaction terms) are subject
  to inflated type I or type II error. While the impact of variance
  change/heterogeneity has been noticed in the literature, few methods have been
  proposed to detect this heterogeneity in a simple, systematic way. In
  addition, when heterogeneity among clusters is detected, researchers often
  wish to know which clusters' variances differed from the others. In this
  study, we utilize a recently proposed family of score-based tests to
  distinguish between cross-level interactions and heterogeneity in variance
  components, also providing information about specific clusters that exhibit
  heterogeneity. These score-based tests only require estimation of the null
  model (when variance homogeneity is assumed to hold), and they have been
  previously applied to psychometric models to detect measurement invariance. In
  this paper, we extend the tests to linear mixed models, allowing us to use the
  tests to differentiate between interaction and heterogeneity. We detail the
  tests' implementation and performance via simulation, provide an empirical
  example of the tests' use in practice, and provide code illustrating the

  presents six scenarios where disgust could be evoked by smells coming from an
  internal source and an external source. The present study aimed to validate
  the BODS in the Italian population and to find further evidence for its
  structural, construct, and criterion validity. Methods: We used two large
  samples (N = 1,050, F = 527; and N = 402, F = 203, respectively) that were
  representative of the Italian population for sex and age. Results: Across
  these two studies, we confirmed the hypothesized bifactor structure, with all
  the items loading onto a general body odor disgust sensitivity factor, and on
  two specific factors related to the internal structure. In terms of construct
  validity, we found that the BODS converged with pathogen disgust sensitivity
  of the three-domain disgust scale (TDDS) but was distinct from a general
  propensity to experience negative emotions. The BODS showed criterion validity
  in predicting the behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 avoidance behavior,
  although it did not seem to be incrementally valid when compared to the TDDS

  general tendency to accept messages. The Multidimensional Iowa Suggestibility
  Scale (MISS) is a self-report scale developed to measure the degree of
  individuals' perceptions of their suggestibility. This study aimed to adapt
  the MISS in an Italian sample. Methods: We conducted two studies. In the first
  study, 345 subjects (270 females (78\%), mean age = 36.21 years ± 14.06 SD)
  completed the translated Italian version of the MISS, composed of five
  subscales (consumer suggestibility; persuadability; sensation contagion;
  physiological reactivity; peer conformity). We investigated the structural
  validity of the scale through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) testing four
  measurement models (unidimensional, four-factor, hierarchical four factors,
  and bifactor) and explored reliability in terms of internal consistency
  through the McDonald's omega. In the second study, we cross-validated the MISS
  on a new independent sample. We enrolled 277 participants (196 females (71\%),
  mean age 30.56, SD = 12.58) who underwent the new version of the scale. We
  performed factor analyses to test structural validity and compared four
  measurement models. Then, we investigated reliability and conducted a latent
  variable analysis to explore divergent validity. Results: The CFA in the first
  study revealed a bifactor solution of the MISS. This structure was
  interpretable and provided an adequate fit for the data. The final version of
  the scale was reduced to forty-six items with globally good indices of
  adaptation. The scale also demonstrated acceptable reliability in terms of
  internal consistency through the McDonald's Hierarchical Omega. In the second
  study, we found that the bifactor structure was confirmed. Factor loadings
  inspection revealed that there was no justification to report only the
  separate scores for the subscales. We also found that the scale showed good
  internal consistency, but mixed evidence for divergent validity. Conclusions:

  analysis of Cirillo et al.'s (2022) study on conceptual alignment in a joint
  picture naming task involving a social robot (Cognition, 227, 105,213). In
  their study, Cirillo and collaborators present evidence suggesting automatic
  alignment by examining response proportions, reflecting adaptation to the
  lexical choices made by the artificial agent (i.e., providing category names
  instead of basic names for specific semantic categories). Here, we conducted a
  complementary analysis using the openly available dataset, employing a
  multiverse approach and focusing on response times as a more nuanced measure
  of cognitive processing and automaticity. Our findings indicate that alignment
  in the Category condition (i.e., when the robot provided a superordinate
  label) is associated with longer response times and greater variability. When
  providing the basic label in the Basic condition, RTs are much shorter and
  variability is reduced, compatible with the Basic-level advantage phenomenon.
  Non-alignment to each condition completely reverses the pattern. This suggests
  that aligning when producing a superordinate label is a strategic and
  effortful rather than an automatic response mechanism. Furthermore, through
  comprehensive visual exploration of response proportions across potentially
  influential variables, we observed category naming alignment primarily
  emerging in specific semantic categories, and mostly for stimuli with basic
  labels at low lexical frequency and newly designed pictures not taken from the
  MultiPic database, thus suggesting a limited generalizability of the effect.
  These insights were confirmed using leave-one-out robustness checks. In
  conclusion, our contribution provides complementary evidence in support of
  strategic rather than automatic responses when aligning with Category labels
  in the analyzed dataset, with a limited generalizability despite all the
  balancing procedures the authors carefully implemented in the experimental
  material. This is likely to reflect individual task strategies rather than
  genuine alignment. Lastly, we suggest directions for future research on
  linguistic alignment, building on insights from both Cirillo et al.'s study
  and our commentary. We also briefly discuss the Open Science principles that

  Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach for approximating empirical

  embedding model) with latent measurement models to assess model fit or misfit
  prior to data collection. To support our statement, we apply SEMbeddings to
  the 96 items of the VIA-IS-P, which measures 24 different character strengths,
  using responses from 31,697 participants. Results: Our analysis shows a
  significant, though not perfect, correlation (r = 0.67) between the cosine
  similarities of embeddings and empirical correlations among items. We then
  demonstrate how to fit confirmatory factor analyses on the cosine similarity
  matrices produced by mpnet-personality and interpret the outcomes using
  modification indices. We found that relying on traditional fit indices when
  using SEMbeddings can be misleading as they often lead to more conservative
  conclusions compared to empirical results. Nevertheless, they provide valuable
  suggestions about possible misfit, and we argue that the modification indices
  obtained from these models could serve as a useful screening tool to make
  informed decisions about items prior to data collection. Discussion: As LLMs
  become increasingly precise and new fine-tuned models are released, these
  procedures have the potential to deliver more reliable results, potentially
  transforming the way new questionnaires are developed.},

  behavioral avoidance motives that prevent people from being in contact with
  pathogens. To date, there has been little agreement on how disgust sensitivity
  might underlie moral judgments. Here, we investigated moral violations of
  "purity" (assumed to elicit disgust) and violations of "harm" (assumed to

  greater condemnation of Purity (vs. Harm) violations. The study was

  dissimilarity with these groups' hygiene and food preparation practices.

  were analyzed, 10 original cases (cohort 1) and 163 literature cases (cohort
  2). Ninety-two percent was term/late preterm neonates (59\% male). Clinical
  presentations included seizures (36\%), apnea (36\%), and encephalopathy
  (18\%). Ninety-four percent was diagnosed with brain magnetic resonance
  imaging and/or cranial ultrasound. Lesions were located in the temporal lobe
  in 60\%, with infarctions adjacent to SPH in 90\%. Sixteen percent died, 53\%
  was diagnosed with neurological impairment, and 8\% with epilepsy. In a
  subcohort of 67 patients (cohort 3) with available individual data (10/10 from
  cohort 1, 57/163 from cohort 2), low birth weight (LBW), seizures, neonatal
  infections, and parenchymal hemorrhage were significantly associated with
  adverse outcomes. CONCLUSION: Neonatal SPH is rare, predominantly located in
  the temporal lobe, and frequently presents with seizures and apneas.
  Neurologic sequelae are common, and parenchymal hemorrhage was strongly
  associated with neurological impairment in our study. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Subpial
  hemorrhage is a rare subtype of intracranial extra-axial bleeding, often
  associated with cortical-subcortical infarction in the adjacent parenchyma,
  predominantly affecting male term neonates. The temporal lobe is the most
  commonly involved area, frequently exhibiting the "yin-yang sign" on brain
  MRI. WHAT IS NEW: • This is the first systematic review of neonatal subpial
  hemorrhage, emphasizing a distinctive clinical presentation marked by seizures
  and apneas (potentially of ictal origin), consistent with a high prevalence of
  temporal lobe involvement. Prognostically, a significant incidence of
  neurological impairment was observed, and the occurrence of parenchymal
  hemorrhage adjacent to subpial hemorrhage was strongly associated with adverse
  outcomes.},

  abstract = {We evaluated the performance of Fitbit Charge 3™ (FC3), a
  multi-sensor commercial sleep-tracker, for measuring sleep in adolescents
  against gold-standard laboratory polysomnography (PSG). Single-night PSG and
  FC3 sleep outcomes were compared in thirty-nine adolescents (22 girls; 16-19
  years), 12 of whom presented with clinical/subclinical DSM-5 insomnia symptoms
  (7 girls). Discrepancy analysis, Bland-Altman plots, and epoch-by-epoch
  analyses were used to evaluate FC3 performance. The influence of several
  factors potentially affecting FC3 performance (e.g., sex, age, body mass
  index, firmware version, and magnitude of heart rate changes between
  consecutive PSG epochs) was also tested. In the sample of healthy adolescents,
  FC3 systematically underestimated PSG total sleep time by about 11 min and
  sleep efficiency by 2.5\%, and overestimated wake after sleep onset by 9 min.
  Proportional biases were detected for "light" and "deep" sleep duration,
  resulting in significant underestimation of these parameters for those
  participants having longer PSG N1+ N2 and N3 durations, respectively. No
  significant systematic bias was detected for sleep efficiency and sleep onset
  latency. Epoch-by-epoch analysis showed sleep-stage sensitivity (average
  proportion of PSG epochs correctly classified by the device for a given sleep
  stage) of 68\% for wake, 78\% for "light" sleep, 59\% for "deep" sleep, and
  69\% for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in healthy sleepers. Similar results
  were found in the sample of adolescents with insomnia symptoms. Body mass
  index was positively associated with FC3-PSG discrepancies in wake after sleep
  onset (R2 = .16, p = .048). The magnitude of the heart rate
  acceleration/deceleration between consecutive PSG epochs was an important
  factor affecting FC3 classifications of sleep stages. Our results are in line
  with a general trend in the literature, suggesting better performance for the
  recently introduced multi-sensor devices compared to motion-only devices,
  although further developments are needed to improve accuracy in sleep stage
  classification and wake detection. Further insight is needed to determine
  factors potentially affecting device performance, such as accuracy and
  reliability (consistency of performance over time), in different samples and
  conditions.},

  data derived from their wearable devices to their providers and the
  ever-increasing availability of commercial devices and new-generation
  research/clinical tools has led to the wide adoption of wearables in research,
  which has become even more relevant given the discontinuation of the Philips
  Respironics Actiwatch. Standards for evaluating the performance of wearable

  suggests that consumer-grade devices exceed the performance of traditional
  actigraphy in assessing sleep as defined by polysomnogram. However, clear
  limitations exist, for example, the misclassification of wakefulness during
  the sleep period, problems with sleep tracking outside of the main sleep bout
  or nighttime period, artifacts, and unclear translation of performance to
  individuals with certain characteristics or comorbidities. This is of
  particular relevance when person-specific factors (like skin color or obesity)
  negatively impact sensor performance with the potential downstream impact of
  augmenting already existing healthcare disparities. However, wearable
  sleep-tracking technology holds great promise for our field, given features
  distinct from traditional actigraphy such as measurement of autonomic
  parameters, estimation of circadian features, and the potential to integrate
  other self-reported, objective, and passively recorded health indicators.
  Scientists face numerous decision points and barriers when incorporating
  traditional actigraphy, consumer-grade multi-sensor devices, or contemporary
  research/clinical-grade sleep trackers into their research. Considerations
  include wearable device capabilities and performance, target population and
  goals of the study, wearable device outputs and availability of raw and

  difficulties in the implementation and utilization of wearable sleep-tracking
  technology in real-world research and clinical settings, the following State

  the following questions. What data can wearable sleep-tracking devices
  provide? How accurate are these data? What should be taken into account when
  incorporating wearable sleep-tracking devices into research? These outstanding

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has recently been growing interest in the roles
  of inflammation in contributing to the development of anxiety in people with
  immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID). Patient-reported outcome
  measures can facilitate the assessment of physical and psychological
  functioning. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s Patient-Reported
  Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) is a set of Patient-Reported
  Outcomes (PROs) that cover physical appearance, mental health, and social
  health. The PROMIS has been built through an Item Response Theory approach
  (IRT), a model-based measurement in which trait level estimates depend on both
  persons' responses and on the properties of the items that were administered.
  The aim of this study is to test the psychometric properties of an Italian
  custom four-item Short Form of the PROMIS Anxiety item bank in a cohort of
  outpatients with IMIDs. METHODS: We selected four items from the Italian
  standard Short Form Anxiety 8a and administered them to consecutive
  outpatients affected by Inflammatory Bowel disease (n = 246), rheumatological
  (n = 100) and dermatological (n = 43) diseases, and healthy volunteers (n =
  280). Data was analyzed through an Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis in
  order to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Italian adaptation of the
  PROMIS anxiety short form. RESULTS: Taken together, Confirmatory Factor
  Analysis and Exploratory Factor analysis suggest that the unidimensionality
  assumption of the instrument holds. The instrument has excellent reliability
  from a Classical Theory of Test (CTT) standpoint (Cronbach's α = 0.93,
  McDonald's ω = 0.92). The 2PL Graded Response Model (GRM) model provided
  showed a better goodness of fit as compared to the 1PL GRM model, and local
  independence assumption appears to be met overall. We did not find signs of
  differential item functioning (DIF) for age and gender, but evidence for
  uniform (but not non-uniform) DIF was found in three out of four items for the
  patient vs. control group. Analysis of the test reliability curve suggested
  that the instrument is most reliable for higher levels of the latent trait of
  anxiety. The groups of patients exhibited higher levels of anxiety as compared
  to the control group (ps < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). The groups of
  patients were not different between themselves (p = 1, Bonferroni-corrected).
  T-scores based on estimated latent trait and raw scores were highly correlated
  (Pearson's r = 0.98) and led to similar results. DISCUSSION: The Italian
  custom four-item short form from the PROMIS anxiety form 8a shows acceptable
  psychometric properties both from a CTT and an IRT standpoint. The Test
  Reliability Curve shows that this instrument is mostly informative for people
  with higher levels of anxiety, making it particularly suitable for clinical
  populations such as IMID patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It remains unclear among clinicians and researchers
  whether orthorexia nervosa (ON) is a part of the obsessive-compulsive disorder
  spectrum or eating disorders. Disgust seems to be a shared psychopathological
  factor in these clinical presentations, indicating a potentially crucial role
  in ON. On the other hand, numerous psychometric tools have been developed to
  evaluate ON. The Dusseldorf Orthorexia Scale (DOS) was recently validated in
  an Italian sample. However, the study's primary limitation was that the scale
  was only administered to undergraduate university students. This study aimed
  to investigate the psychometric properties (including factorial structure,
  reliability, and measurement invariance conditional on sex) of the Italian
  version of the DOS (I-DOS) on a sample from the general population.
  Additionally, the study sought to determine the nomological validity of the
  I-DOS by examining its relationship with disgust sensitivity. METHODS: A
  sample of 521 participants took part in this study and completed a battery
  that assessed ON and disgust sensitivity. To assess the I-DOS structure,
  reliability, and measurement invariance we respectively conducted confirmatory
  factor analysis (CFA), computed McDonalds's omega, and performed hierarchical
  series of multigroup CFAs. Then, we tested the relationship between ON and
  disgust sensitivity. RESULTS: CFA confirmed the unifactorial model of I-DOS
  and it respected the configural, metric, and strict invariance while a partial
  scalar invariance was achieved. It also showed good reliability with an omega
  of 0.87. In addition, we found a positive relationship between ON and disgust
  sensitivity, thus confirming the nomological validity of I-DOS. CONCLUSIONS:
  Our findings suggest that the Italian version of the Dusseldorf orthorexia
  scale (I-DOS) exhibits strong psychometric properties and can be an effective
  instrument for assessing ON in a general population sample. Notably, the most
  significant and innovative outcome was the positive correlation between ON and
  disgust sensitivity. As disgust has been linked to other clinical
  presentations, this preliminary result could serve as a foundation for future
  research exploring this phenomenon in greater detail.},

  abstract = {The study of moral judgements often centres on moral dilemmas in
  which options consistent with deontological perspectives (that is, emphasizing
  rules, individual rights and duties) are in conflict with options consistent
  with utilitarian judgements (that is, following the greater good based on
  consequences). Greene et al. (2009) showed that psychological and situational
  factors (for example, the intent of the agent or the presence of physical
  contact between the agent and the victim) can play an important role in moral
  dilemma judgements (for example, the trolley problem). Our knowledge is
  limited concerning both the universality of these effects outside the United
  States and the impact of culture on the situational and psychological factors
  affecting moral judgements. Thus, we empirically tested the universality of
  the effects of intent and personal force on moral dilemma judgements by
  replicating the experiments of Greene et al. in 45 countries from all
  inhabited continents. We found that personal force and its interaction with
  intention exert influence on moral judgements in the US and Western cultural
  clusters, replicating and expanding the original findings. Moreover, the
  personal force effect was present in all cultural clusters, suggesting it is
  culturally universal. The evidence for the cultural universality of the
  interaction effect was inconclusive in the Eastern and Southern cultural
  clusters (depending on exclusion criteria). We found no strong association
  between collectivism/individualism and moral dilemma judgements.},

  abstract = {Over the past 10 years, Oosterhof and Todorov's valence-dominance
  model has emerged as the most prominent account of how people evaluate faces
  on social dimensions. In this model, two dimensions (valence and dominance)
  underpin social judgements of faces. Because this model has primarily been
  developed and tested in Western regions, it is unclear whether these findings
  apply to other regions. We addressed this question by replicating Oosterhof
  and Todorov's methodology across 11 world regions, 41 countries and 11,570
  participants. When we used Oosterhof and Todorov's original analysis strategy,
  the valence-dominance model generalized across regions. When we used an
  alternative methodology to allow for correlated dimensions, we observed much
  less generalization. Collectively, these results suggest that, while the
  valence-dominance model generalizes very well across regions when dimensions
  are forced to be orthogonal, regional differences are revealed when we use
  different extraction methods and correlate and rotate the dimension reduction

  abstract = {AbstractConcerns over the replicability and reproducibility of
  published research have grown in many research fields, but empirical data to
  inform policies are still scarce. Biomedical research in Brazil expanded
  rapidly over the last three decades, with no systematic assessment of the
  replicability of its findings. With this in mind, we set up the Brazilian
  Reproducibility Initiative, a multicenter replication of published experiments
  from Brazilian science using three common experimental methods: the MTT assay,
  the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the elevated
  plus maze (EPM). A total of 56 laboratories performed 143 replications of 56
  experiments; of these, 97 replications of 47 experiments were considered valid
  by an independent committee. Replication rates for these experiments varied
  between 15 and 45\% according to five predefined criteria. In median terms,
  relative effects (expressed as ratios between group means) were 60\% larger in
  original experiments than in replications, while coefficients of variation
  were 60\% smaller. Effect size decrease was smaller for MTT, cell line
  experiments and original results with less variability, while t values for
  replications were positively correlated with researcher predictions about
  replicability. Deviations from preregistered protocols were very common in
  replications, most frequently due to reasons inherent to the experimental
  model or related to infrastructure and logistics. Our results highlight
  factors that limit the replicability of results published by researchers in
  Brazil and suggest ways by which this scenario can be improved.},

  models often hypothesize that variables interact to influence the probability
  of an event, Pr(Y). The current typical approach to testing such hypotheses is
  (1) estimate a logit or probit model with a product term, (2) test the
  hypothesis by determining whether the coefficient for this term is

  of one variable on Pr(Y) may be strongly related to the value of another. We

  a prediction interval, a range of results that can be expected in a

  calculable based on objective study characteristics (i.e., effect size of the

  even when sample sizes across studies are unequal. The prediction interval
  provides an a priori method for assessing if the difference between an

  sample error alone. We provide open-source software tools that allow
  researchers, reviewers, replicators, and editors to easily calculate

  amounts of measurement error can have on observed associations. In the second

  relative importance of both sampling error and measurement error in producing

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of
  cancer deaths in women in the United States. Numerous gene signatures of
  patient prognosis have been proposed, but diverse data and methods make these
  difficult to compare or use in a clinically meaningful way. We sought to
  identify successful published prognostic gene signatures through systematic
  validation using public data. METHODS: A systematic review identified 14
  prognostic models for late-stage ovarian cancer. For each, we evaluated its 1)
  reimplementation as described by the original study, 2) performance for
  prognosis of overall survival in independent data, and 3) performance compared
  with random gene signatures. We compared and ranked models by validation in 10
  published datasets comprising 1251 primarily high-grade, late-stage serous
  ovarian cancer patients. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.
  RESULTS: Twelve published models had 95\% confidence intervals of the C-index
  that did not include the null value of 0.5; eight outperformed 97.5\% of
  signatures including the same number of randomly selected genes and trained on
  the same data. The four top-ranked models achieved overall validation
  C-indices of 0.56 to 0.60 and shared anticorrelation with expression of immune
  response pathways. Most models demonstrated lower accuracy in new datasets
  than in validation sets presented in their publication. CONCLUSIONS: This
  analysis provides definitive support for a handful of prognostic models but
  also confirms that these require improvement to be of clinical value. This
  work addresses outstanding controversies in the ovarian cancer literature and
  provides a reproducible framework for meta-analytic evaluation of gene
  signatures.},

  increasingly common, but there has been no unified approach to doing so. Some
  evaluations conduct only a single replication study while others run several,
  usually across multiple laboratories. Designing such programs has largely
  contended with difficult issues about which experimental components are
  necessary for a set of studies to be considered replications. However, another
  important consideration is that replication studies be designed to support
  sufficiently sensitive analyses. For instance, if hypothesis tests are to be
  conducted about replication, studies should be designed to ensure these tests
  are well-powered; if not, it can be difficult to determine conclusively if
  replication attempts succeeded or failed. This paper describes methods for
  designing ensembles of replication studies to ensure that they are both
  adequately sensitive and cost-efficient. It describes two potential analyses
  of replication studies—hypothesis tests and variance component estimation—and
  approaches to obtaining optimal designs for them. Using these results, it
  assesses the statistical power, precision of point estimators and optimality
  of the design used by the Many Labs Project and finds that while it may have
  been sufficiently powered to detect some larger differences between studies,
  other designs would have been less costly and/or produced more precise
  estimates or higher-powered hypothesis tests.},

  numerical values (117), with the rest being reported as representative images

  methods were not suitable for all the effects in our sample. One method
  compared effect sizes: for positive effects, the median effect size in the
  replications was 85\% smaller than the median effect size in the original
  experiments, and 92\% of replication effect sizes were smaller than the
  original. The other methods were binary - the replication was either a success
  or a failure - and five of these methods could be used to assess both positive
  and null effects when effect sizes were reported as numerical values. For
  positive effects, 40\% of replications (39/97) succeeded according to three or

  typical ES conventionally regarded as “small.” However, the overall difference

  separation between male and female distributions. (2) In a recent
  meta-analytic summary of sex differences in aggression, the individual ESs

  abstract = {AbstractStatistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason
  is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some
  threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased
  reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be
  expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single
  studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from
  replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random
  variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as
  failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A
  general perception of a ?replication crisis? may thus reflect failure to
  recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless
  assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because
  of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical
  inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local
  descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as
  providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means
  we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and
  uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could
  help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be
  large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is
  simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results.
  Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should
  thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems
  occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why,
  and what output those methods produced.},

  Looking for consistency between two studies is challenging because individual
  studies are susceptible to many sources of error that can cause study results

  directions and magnitudes. In the current paper, we derive methods to compute
  a prediction interval, a range of results that can be expected in a

  indexes of effect size: correlations and d-values. The prediction interval is
  calculable based on objective study characteristics (i.e., effect size of the
  original study and sample sizes of the original study and planned replication)
  even when sample sizes across studies are unequal. The prediction interval
  provides an a priori method for assessing if the difference between an

  sample error alone. We provide open-source software tools that allow

  the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive
  functioning. However, results of these studies frequently display
  inconsistency and pose challenges regarding replicability. The present work
  aimed at testing the hypothesis of mood as potential moderator of prefrontal
  tDCS effects on executive functions (EF). This hypothesis refers to the
  relationship between mood and EF, as well as to the association of mood with
  the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity. METHODS: We conducted a
  meta-analysis of 11 articles where the dlPFC was stimulated with anodal tDCS,
  EF were measured, and mood was assessed prior to the stimulation. We then
  conducted a meta-regression to examine whether mood moderated the tDCS effects
  on EF. RESULTS: While no significant effect of tDCS on EF emerged from the
  meta-analysis, the meta-regression indicated that mood plays a significant
  role as moderator, with greater tDCS effects on EF in individuals with higher
  depressive symptoms. LIMITATIONS: The limited number of studies included, the
  heterogeneous samples considered, and the limited generalizability to other
  non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and affective states. CONCLUSIONS:
  Findings suggest that evaluating mood prior to stimulation could increase the
  sensitivity and specificity of tDCS application, and provide the first
  meta-analytic evidence in favor of the affective state-dependency hypothesis.},

  scientific field. In this paper, we argue that prevention science will be
  better positioned to help improve public health if (a) more replications are
  conducted; (b) those replications are systematic, thoughtful, and conducted
  with full knowledge of the trials that have preceded them; and (c)
  state-of-the art techniques are used to summarize the body of evidence on the
  effects of the interventions. Under real-world demands it is often not
  feasible to wait for multiple replications to accumulate before making
  decisions about intervention adoption. To help individuals and agencies make
  better decisions about intervention utility, we outline strategies that can be
  used to help understand the likely direction, size, and range of intervention
  effects as suggested by the current knowledge base. We also suggest structural
  changes that could increase the amount and quality of replication research,
  such as the provision of incentives and a more vigorous pursuit of prospective
  research registers. Finally, we discuss methods for integrating replications
  into the roll-out of a program and suggest that strong partnerships with local
  decision makers are a key component of success in replication research. Our
  hope is that this paper can highlight the importance of replication and
  stimulate more discussion of the important elements of the replication
  process. We are confident that, armed with more and better replications and
  state-of-the-art review methods, prevention science will be in a better

  predictive distribution contains datasets that are expected given the original
  results. To determine whether the new data resulting from a replication study
  deviate from the data in the prior predictive distribution, we need to
  calculate a test statistic for each dataset. We propose to use ̄F, which
  measures to what degree the results of a dataset deviate from an inequality
  constrained hypothesis capturing the relevant features of the original study:
  HRF. The inequality constraints in HRF are based on the findings of the
  original study and can concern, for example, the ordering of means and
  interaction effects. The prior predictive p-value consequently tests to what
  degree the new data deviates from predicted data given the original results,
  considering the findings of the original study. We explain the calculation of
  the prior predictive p-value step by step, elaborate on the topic of power,

  analyzing underpowered studies with thresholds of statistical significance is
  a high risk of finding exaggerated effect size estimates, in the right or the
  wrong direction. These inferential risks can be directly quantified in terms
  of Type M (magnitude) error and Type S (sign) error, which directly
  communicate the consequences of design choices on effect size estimation.
  Given a study design, Type M error is the factor by which a statistically
  significant effect is on average exaggerated. Type S error is the probability
  to find a statistically significant result in the opposite direction to the
  plausible one. Ideally, these errors should be considered during a prospective
  design analysis in the design phase of a study to determine the appropriate
  sample size. However, they can also be considered when evaluating studies’
  results in a retrospective design analysis. In the present contribution, we
  aim to facilitate the considerations of these errors in the research practice
  in psychology. For this reason, we illustrate how to consider Type M and Type
  S errors in a design analysis using one of the most common effect size
  measures in psychology: Pearson correlation coefficient. We provide various

  the quality of experience is specified by the set of informational
  relationships generated within that complex. Integrated information (Phi) is
  defined as the amount of information generated by a complex of elements, above

  where each axis represents a possible state of the complex, each point is a
  probability distribution of its states, and arrows between points represent
  the informational relationships among its elements generated by causal
  mechanisms (connections). Together, the set of informational relationships
  within a complex constitute a shape in Q that completely and univocally
  specifies a particular experience. Several observations concerning the neural
  substrate of consciousness fall naturally into place within the IIT framework.
  Among them are the association of consciousness with certain neural systems

  consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural processes that remain
  unconscious; the reduction of consciousness during dreamless sleep and

  needed. This paper reports the results of simulations showing that the two
  most common methods for evaluating significance, using likelihood ratio tests

  Other methods for evaluating significance, including parametric bootstrapping

  responsible for these effects and how they are modulated by individual
  differences in sensitivity to threat are unclear. Here we studied subliminal
  affective priming by recording brain potentials to surprise faces preceded by
  30-msec happy or fearful prime faces. Participants showed valence-consistent
  changes in affective ratings of surprise faces, although they reported no
  knowledge of prime-face expressions, nor could they discriminate between
  prime-face expressions in a forced-choice test. In conjunction with the
  priming effect on affective evaluation, larger occipital P1 potentials at
  145-175 msec were found with fearful than with happy primes, and source
  analyses implicated the bilateral extrastriate cortex in this effect. Later
  brain potentials at 300-400 msec were enhanced with happy versus fearful
  primes, which may reflect differential attentional orienting. Personality
  testing for sensitivity to threat, especially social threat, was also used to
  evaluate individual differences potentially relevant to subliminal affective
  priming. Indeed, participants with high trait anxiety demonstrated stronger
  affective priming and greater P1 differences than did those with low trait
  anxiety, and these effects were driven by fearful primes. Results thus suggest
  that unconsciously perceived affective information influences social judgments
  by altering very early perceptual analyses, and that this influence is
  accentuated to the extent that people are oversensitive to threat. In this
  way, perception may be subject to a variety of influences that govern social
  preferences in the absence of concomitant awareness of such influences.},

  processing, in e.g., perceptual or memory tasks, is often referred to as
  metacognition. How should we quantitatively measure such ability? Here we
  focus on a class of measures that assess the correspondence between
  trial-by-trial accuracy and one's own confidence. In general, for healthy
  subjects endowed with metacognitive sensitivity, when one is confident, one is
  more likely to be correct. Thus, the degree of association between accuracy
  and confidence can be taken as a quantitative measure of metacognition.
  However, many studies use a statistical correlation coefficient (e.g.,
  Pearson's r) or its variant to assess this degree of association, and such
  measures are susceptible to undesirable influences from factors such as
  response biases. Here we review other measures based on signal detection
  theory and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis that are "bias
  free," and relate these quantities to the calibration and discrimination
  measures developed in the probability estimation literature. We go on to
  distinguish between the related concepts of metacognitive bias (a difference
  in subjective confidence despite basic task performance remaining constant),
  metacognitive sensitivity (how good one is at distinguishing between one's own
  correct and incorrect judgments) and metacognitive efficiency (a subject's
  level of metacognitive sensitivity given a certain level of task performance).

  provides an agnostic assessment of the model's behavior not only under the
  null hypothesis, but also under a realistic alternative. The simulation
  results from the artificial data demonstrate the advantages of the Bayesian
  model. The 1 - AUC values for the Bayesian model are roughly half of the
  corresponding values for a direct combination of t- and SAM-statistics.
  Furthermore, the simulations provide guidelines for when the Bayesian model is
  most likely to be useful. Most noticeably, in small studies the Bayesian model
  generally outperforms other methods when evaluated by AUC, FDR, and MDR across
  a range of simulation parameters, and this difference diminishes for larger
  sample sizes in the individual studies. The split-study validation illustrates
  appropriate shrinkage of the Bayesian model in the absence of platform-,

  testing for (a) the presence of an ERP effect, (b) within-participant
  condition differences in an ERP effect, and (c) between-participants group
  differences in an ERP effect. Each of these issues was examined in the context
  of the error-related negativity and the lateralized readiness potential. We
  found that doubling the number of trials recommended by previous studies led
  to more than a doubling of statistical power under many conditions. Thus, when
  determining the number of trials that should be included in a given study,
  researchers must consider the sample size, the anticipated effect magnitude,
  and the noise level, rather than relying solely on general recommendations
  about the number of trials needed to obtain a "stable" ERP waveform.},

  correlations during rest and task performance, consistently higher
  correlations within the CCN than the rest of cortex, co-activation in a visual
  search task, and mutual sensitivity to decision difficulty. Regions within the
  CCN include anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplementary motor area (ACC/pSMA),
  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), inferior frontal junction (IFJ),
  anterior insular cortex (AIC), dorsal pre-motor cortex (dPMC), and posterior
  parietal cortex (PPC). We used a novel visual line search task which included
  periods when the probe stimuli were occluded but subjects had to maintain and
  update working memory in preparation for the sudden appearance of a probe
  stimulus. The six CCN regions operated as a tightly coupled network during the
  'non-occluded' portions of this task, with all regions responding to probe
  events. In contrast, the network was differentiated during occluded search.
  DLPFC, not ACC/pSMA, was involved in target memory maintenance when probes
  were absent, while both regions became active in preparation for difficult
  probes at the end of each occluded period. This approach illustrates one way

  meta-analytical decisions or do most analytical strategies reaching the same
  conclusion? OBJECTIVE: We aim to solve these discrepancies by conducting a
  multiverse meta-analysis containing all possible meta-analyses, using all
  statistical methods. STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: We searched four
  bibliographical databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Register of
  Controlled Trials), including studies published until 1 January 2022. We
  included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychotherapies with
  control conditions without restricting the type of psychotherapy, target
  group, intervention format, control condition and diagnosis. We defined all
  possible meta-analyses emerging from combinations of these inclusion criteria
  and estimated the resulting pooled effect sizes with fixed-effect,
  random-effects, 3-level, robust variance estimation, p-uniform and PET-PEESE
  (precision-effect test and precision-effect estimate with SE) meta-analysis
  models. This study was preregistered
  (https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050197). FINDINGS: A total of 21 563
  records were screened, and 3584 full texts were retrieved; 415 studies met our
  inclusion criteria containing 1206 effect sizes and 71 454 participants. Based
  on all possible combinations between inclusion criteria and meta-analytical
  methods, we calculated 4281 meta-analyses. The average summary effect size for
  these meta-analyses was Hedges' g mean=0.56, a medium effect size, and ranged
  from g=-0.66 to 2.51. In total, 90\% of these meta-analyses reached a
  clinically relevant magnitude. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The
  multiverse meta-analysis revealed the overall robustness of the effectiveness
  of psychotherapies for depression. Notably, meta-analyses that included
  studies with a high risk of bias, compared the intervention with wait-list
  control groups, and not correcting for publication bias produced larger effect

  (p-hacking) from this "multiverse" of outcomes can inflate effect size
  estimates and false positive rates. We studied the effects of researcher
  degrees of freedom and selective reporting using empirical data from extensive
  multistudy projects in psychology (Registered Replication Reports) featuring
  211 samples and 14 dependent variables. We used a counterfactual design to
  examine what biases could have emerged if the studies (and ensuing
  meta-analyses) had not been preregistered and could have been subjected to
  selective reporting based on the significance of the outcomes in the primary
  studies. Our results show the substantial variability in effect sizes that
  researcher degrees of freedom can create in relatively standard psychological
  studies, and how selective reporting of outcomes can alter conclusions and
  introduce bias in meta-analysis. Despite the typically thousands of outcomes
  appearing in the multiverses of the 294 included studies, only in about 30\%
  of studies did significant effect sizes in the hypothesized direction emerge.
  We also observed that the effect of a particular researcher degree of freedom
  was inconsistent across replication studies using the same protocol, meaning
  multiverse analyses often fail to replicate across samples. We recommend
  hypothesis-testing researchers to preregister their preferred analysis and
  openly report multiverse analysis. We propose a descriptive index (underlying
  multiverse variability) that quantifies the robustness of results across
  alternative ways to analyze the data. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA,

  design prior distribution for the underlying parameters. Based on a design
  prior, predictions about the replication data can be made, and the replication
  sample size can be chosen to ensure a sufficiently high probability of
  replication success. Replication success may be defined by Bayesian or
  non-Bayesian criteria and different criteria may also be combined to meet
  distinct stakeholders and enable conclusive inferences based on multiple
  analysis approaches. We investigate sample size determination in the
  normal-normal hierarchical model where analytical results are available and
  traditional sample size determination is a special case where the uncertainty
  on parameter values is not accounted for. We use data from a multisite
  replication project of social-behavioral experiments to illustrate how
  Bayesian approaches can help design informative and cost-effective replication
  studies. Our methods can be used through the R package BayesRepDesign.

  among scientists that the lack of reproducibility in psychology and other
  fields stems from various methodological factors, including low statistical
  power, researcher's degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on publishing
  surprising positive results. However, there is a contentious debate about the
  extent to which failures to reproduce certain results might also reflect
  contextual differences (often termed "hidden moderators") between the original
  research and the replication attempt. Although psychologists have found
  extensive evidence that contextual factors alter behavior, some have argued
  that context is unlikely to influence the results of direct replications
  precisely because these studies use the same methods as those used in the
  original research. To help resolve this debate, we recoded the 100 original
  studies from the Reproducibility Project on the extent to which the research
  topic of each study was contextually sensitive. Results suggested that the
  contextual sensitivity of the research topic was associated with replication
  success, even after statistically adjusting for several methodological
  characteristics (e.g., statistical power, effect size). The association
  between contextual sensitivity and replication success did not differ across
  psychological subdisciplines. These results suggest that researchers,

  sizes to increase power or using a lower alpha level. However, little
  attention has been paid to how the prior odds ( R) that a tested effect is
  true can affect the probability that a significant result will be replicable.
  The lower R is, the less likely a published result will be replicable even if
  power is high. It follows that if R is lower in one set of studies than in
  another, then all else being equal, published results will be less replicable
  in the set with lower R. We illustrate this point by presenting an analysis of
  data from the social-psychology and cognitive-psychology studies that were
  included in the Open Science Collaboration’s (2015) replication project. We
  found that R was lower for the social-psychology studies than for the
  cognitive-psychology studies, which might explain why the rate of successful
  replications differed between these two sets of studies. This difference in
  replication rates may reflect the degree to which scientists in the two fields
  value risky but potentially groundbreaking (i.e., low- R) research.
  Critically, high- R research is not inherently better or worse than low- R
  research for advancing knowledge. However, if they wish to achieve replication
  rates comparable to those of high- R fields (a judgment call), researchers in
  low- R fields would need to use an especially low alpha level, conduct

  abstract = {What is best criterion for determining statistical significance?
  In psychology, the criterion has been p < .05. This criterion has been
  criticized since its inception, and the criticisms have been rejuvenated with
  recent failures to replicate studies published in top psychology journals.
  Several replacement criteria have been suggested including reducing the alpha
  level to .005 or switching to other types of criteria such as Bayes factors or
  effect sizes. Here, various decision criteria for statistical significance
  were evaluated using signal detection analysis on the outcomes of simulated
  data. The signal detection measure of area under the curve (AUC) is a measure
  of discriminability with a value of 1 indicating perfect discriminability and
  0.5 indicating chance performance. Applied to criteria for statistical
  significance, it provides an estimate of the decision criterion’s performance
  in discriminating real effects from null effects. AUCs were high (M = .96,
  median = .97) for p values, suggesting merit in using p values to discriminate
  significant effects. AUCs can be used to assess methodological questions such
  as how much improvement will be gained with increased sample size, how much
  discriminability will be lost with questionable research practices, and
  whether it is better to run a single high-powered study or a study plus a
  replication at lower powers. AUCs were also used to compare performance across
  p values, Bayes factors, and effect size (Cohen’s d). AUCs were equivalent for
  p values and Bayes factors and were slightly higher for effect size. Signal
  detection analysis provides separate measures of discriminability and bias.
  With respect to bias, the specific thresholds that produced maximally-optimal
  utility depended on sample size, although this dependency was particularly
  notable for p values and less so for Bayes factors. The application of signal
  detection theory to the issue of statistical significance highlights the need
  to focus on both false alarms and misses, rather than false alarms alone.},

  depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being
  closely aligned - that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of
  hypothetical observations. Here, I argue that many applications of statistical
  inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the
  most widely used class of model in psychology - the linear mixed model - I
  explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal
  hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization
  intentions. I demonstrate that although the "random effect" formalism is used
  pervasively in psychology to model intersubject variability, few researchers
  accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize
  over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of
  random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of
  results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can
  dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw
  sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the
  statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to
  take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies
  at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication

  abstract = {The current crisis in scientific psychology about whether our
  findings are irreproducible was presaged years ago by Tversky and Kahneman
  (1971), who noted that even sophisticated researchers believe in the
  fallacious Law of Small Numbers-erroneous intuitions about how imprecisely
  sample data reflect population phenomena. Combined with the low power of most
  current work, this often leads to the use of misleading criteria about whether
  an effect has replicated. Rosenthal (1990) suggested more appropriate
  criteria, here labeled the continuously cumulating meta-analytic (CCMA)
  approach. For example, a CCMA analysis on a replication attempt that does not
  reach significance might nonetheless provide more, not less, evidence that the
  effect is real. Alternatively, measures of heterogeneity might show that two
  studies that differ in whether they are significant might have only trivially
  different effect sizes. We present a nontechnical introduction to the CCMA
  framework (referencing relevant software), and then explain how it can be used
  to address aspects of replicability or more generally to assess quantitative
  evidence from numerous studies. We then present some examples and simulation
  results using the CCMA approach that show how the combination of evidence can
  yield improved results over the consideration of single studies.},

  level of significance at replication if the original study is already

  Downweighting the original study accounts for possible bias and requires a

  is to use a mixture of the posterior distribution based on the original study

  replication study. The mixture weight then determines the extent to which the
  original and replication data are pooled. Two distinct strategies are
  presented: one with fixed mixture weights, and one that introduces uncertainty
  by assigning a prior distribution to the mixture weight itself. Furthermore,
  it is shown how within this framework Bayes factors can be used for formal
  testing of scientific hypotheses, such as tests regarding the presence or

  methodology, we analyze data from three replication studies. Our findings

  particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical

  against a theory, or if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must
  use one of: power, intervals (such as confidence or credibility intervals), or
  else an indicator of the relative evidence for one theory over another, such
  as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes factors allow theory to be linked to data in
  a way that overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches. Specifically,
  Bayes factors use the data themselves to determine their sensitivity in
  distinguishing theories (unlike power), and they make use of those aspects of
  a theory's predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power and
  intervals, which require specifying the minimal interesting value in order to
  address theory). Bayes factors provide a coherent approach to determining
  whether non-significant results support a null hypothesis over a theory, or
  whether the data are just insensitive. They allow accepting and rejecting the
  null hypothesis to be put on an equal footing. Concrete examples are provided
  to indicate the range of application of a simple online Bayes calculator,

  degree of clarity of her experience according to the perceptual awareness
  scale. In the first experiment, SL demonstrated a performance above-chance in
  the discrimination task for "guessed" trials, thus showing type 1 blindsight.
  In the second experiment, however, SL showed above-chance performance only
  when she reported a certain degree of awareness, thus showing that SL's
  preserved discrimination ability relies on conscious vision. These data show
  that graded measures to assess awareness, which can better tap on the

  suggest that the primary visual cortex (V1) plays a unique role in visual
  awareness, and that extrastriate activation needs to be fed back to V1 in
  order for the content of that activation to be consciously perceived. The aim
  of this review is to evaluate this theoretical framework and to revisit its
  key tenets. Firstly, is blindsight truly a dissociation of awareness and
  visual detection? Secondly, is there sufficient evidence to rule out the
  possibility that the loss of awareness resulting from a V1 lesion simply
  reflects reduced extrastriate responsiveness, rather than a unique role of V1
  in conscious experience? Evaluation of these arguments and the empirical
  evidence leads to the conclusion that the loss of phenomenal awareness in
  blindsight may not be due to feedback activity in V1 being the hallmark
  awareness. On the basis of existing literature, an alternative explanation of
  blindsight is proposed. In this view, visual awareness is a “global” cognitive
  function as its hallmark is the availability of information to a large number
  of perceptual and cognitive systems; this requires inter-areal long-range
  synchronous oscillatory activity. For these oscillations to arise, a specific
  temporal profile of neuronal activity is required, which is established
  through recurrent feedback activity involving V1 and the extrastriate cortex.
  When V1 is lesioned, the loss of recurrent activity prevents inter-areal
  networks on the basis of oscillatory activity. However, as limited amount of
  input can reach extrastriate cortex and some extrastriate neuronal selectivity
  is preserved, computations involving comparison of neural firing rates within
  a cortical area remain possible. This enables “local” read-out from specific
  brain regions, allowing for the detection and discrimination of basic visual
  attributes. Thus blindsight is blind due to lack of “global” long-range
  synchrony, and it functions via “local” neural readout from extrastriate
  areas.},

  empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology
  and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and
  control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using
  standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges' d or the response ratio.
  However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the
  variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be
  informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition
  to or instead of the mean. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic
  lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of
  variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare
  differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of
  lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. Further, as an alternative
  approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log
  standard deviation) and lnx- (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed)
  model. The use of ln s with lnx- overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and
  it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation
  beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use
  of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. Our
  approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published
  meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially
  overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be
  applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has
  an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the
  application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and
  evolution.},

  masking adapted to a near-threshold paradigm. The masking intensity was
  adjusted to the individual perception threshold, at which individual
  alphabetical letters, but not words, could be perceived in approximately half
  of the trials. We confined perception to a pre-lexical stage of word
  processing that corresponded to a clear condition of partial awareness. At
  this level of representation, the stimulus properties began to emerge within
  consciousness, yet they did not escalate to full stimulus awareness. In other
  words, participants were able to perceive individual letters, while remaining
  unaware of the whole letter strings presented. Cortical activity measured with
  MEG was compared between physically identical trials that differed in
  perception (perceived, not perceived). We found that compared to no awareness,
  partial awareness of words was characterized by suppression of oscillatory
  alpha power in left temporal and parietal cortices. The analysis of functional
  connectivity with seeds based on the power effect in these two regions
  revealed sparse connections for the parietal seed, and strong connections

  resulting in delusions, hallucinations, and cognitive impairments. Across a
  variety of paradigms, an elevated threshold for conscious perception has been
  repeatedly observed in persons with schizophrenia. Remarkably, even subtle
  measures of subliminal processing appear to be preserved. We argue here that
  the dissociation between impaired conscious access and intact unconscious
  processing may be due to a specific disruption of top-down attentional
  amplification. This proposal is compatible with the neurophysiological
  disturbances observed in schizophrenia, including dysconnectivity, abnormal
  neural oscillations, and glutamatergic and cholinergic dysregulation.
  Therefore, placing impaired conscious access as a central feature of
  schizophrenia can help researchers develop a coherent and parsimonious
  pathophysiological framework of the disease. Patients with schizophrenia
  exhibit impairments of conscious processing and an elevated threshold for
  conscious perception, while subliminal processing is preserved. The sensory
  impairments in schizophrenia could be explained by a disorder of conscious
  top-down attentional amplification rather than by bottom-up processing
  deficits. Bayesian models account for the emergence of delusions through
  inappropriate updating of conscious representations according to sensory
  evidence. Brain-imaging and neurophysiological studies of schizophrenia reveal
  anomalies in long-distance connectivity and synchrony between distant brain
  areas that may have a pivotal role in the disruption of conscious access. NMDA
  receptors may have an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia:
  there is growing evidence that NMDA receptors are dysregulated in this

  related to recurrent activity in distributed cortical networks, although brain
  mechanisms controlling unconscious processing and stimuli access to conscious
  report need to be clarified. Objective: This study aims at investigating
  modulations in cortical excitability related to conscious perception and
  unconscious processing of face stimuli with different visibility levels.
  Methods: We used TMS-EEG over the right occipital face area (rOFA), or the
  right premotor cortex (rPMC) as control site, to measure cortical excitability
  during a backward masking paradigm with individually defined stimuli
  visibility. Results: Event related potentials showed significant differences
  for faces compared to houses, and detected faces compared to missed ones, 200
  ms post target onset. TMS over rOFA, but not over rPMC, triggered a relative
  positivity starting 150 ms post target when faces with high visibility were
  consciously reported. Moreover, rOFA TMS evoked differential responses for
  high versus low visible faces in conscious and unconscious processing at
  290–390 and 180–240 ms, respectively. Conclusion: Results unveiled a causal
  link between rOFA excitability and late responses related to access to

  in the macaque inferior temporal visual cortex have responses that are
  invariant with respect to the position, size, view, and spatial frequency of
  faces and objects, and that these neurons show rapid processing and rapid
  learning. Critical band spatial frequency masking is shown to be a property of
  these face-selective neurons and of the human visual perception of faces.
  Which face or object is present is encoded using a distributed representation
  in which each neuron conveys independent information in its firing rate, with
  little information evident in the relative time of firing of different
  neurons. This ensemble encoding has the advantages of maximizing the
  information in the representation useful for discrimination between stimuli
  using a simple weighted sum of the neuronal firing by the receiving neurons,
  generalization, and graceful degradation. These invariant representations are
  ideally suited to provide the inputs to brain regions such as the
  orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala that learn the reinforcement associations of
  an individual's face, for then the learning, and the appropriate social and
  emotional responses generalize to other views of the same face. A theory is
  described of how such invariant representations may be produced by
  self-organizing learning in a hierarchically organized set of visual cortical
  areas with convergent connectivity. The theory utilizes either temporal or
  spatial continuity with an associative synaptic modification rule. Another
  population of neurons in the cortex in the superior temporal sulcus encodes
  other aspects of faces such as face expression, eye-gaze, face view, and
  whether the head is moving. These neurons thus provide important additional
  inputs to parts of the brain such as the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala
  that are involved in social communication and emotional behaviour. Outputs of
  these systems reach the amygdala, in which face-selective neurons are found,
  and also the orbitofrontal cortex, in which some neurons are tuned to face
  identity and others to face expression. In humans, activation of the
  orbitofrontal cortex is found when a change of face expression acts as a
  social signal that behaviour should change; and damage to the human
  orbitofrontal and pregenual cingulate cortex can impair face and voice
  expression identification, and also the reversal of emotional behaviour that
  normally occurs when reinforcers are reversed.},

  modifying the context in which they are presented, but not by modifying the
  targets themselves. Here I summarize a decade of experimentation using visual
  masking illusions in which my colleagues and I have begun to establish the
  minimal set of conditions necessary to maintain the awareness of the
  visibility of simple unattended stimuli. We have established that
  spatiotemporal edges must be present for targets to be visible. These
  spatiotemporal edges must be encoded by transient bursts of spikes in the
  early visual system. If these bursts are inhibited, visibility fails.
  Target-correlated activity must rise within the visual hierarchy at least to
  the level of V3, and be processed within the occipital lobe, to achieve
  visibility. The specific circuits that maintain visibility are not yet known,
  but we have deduced that lateral inhibition plays a critical role in sculpting
  our perception of visibility, both by causing interactions between stimuli
  positioned across space, and also by shaping the responses to stimuli across
  time. Further, the studies have served to narrow the number of possible
  theories to explain visibility and visual masking. Finally, we have discovered
  that lateral inhibition builds iteratively in strength throughout the visual
  hierarchy, for both monoptic and dichoptic stimuli. Since binocular
  information is not integrated until inputs from the two eyes reach the primary
  visual cortex, it follows that the early visual areas contain differential
  levels of monoptic and dichoptic lateral inhibitions. We exploited this fact
  to discover that excitatory integration of binocular inputs occurs at an
  earlier level than interocular suppression. These findings are potentially
  fundamental to our understanding of all forms of binocular vision and to
  determining the role of binocular rivalry in visual awareness. © 2006 Elsevier

  however, global pre-stimulus connectivity patterns could be as crucial as

  subject-specific peak latency of a late positive TMS-evoked potential. Our

  This automatic mimicry reflects underlying sensorimotor simulation that
  supports accurate emotion recognition. Why this is so is becoming more
  obvious: emotions are patterns of expressive, behavioral, physiological, and
  subjective feeling responses. Activation of one component can therefore
  automatically activate other components. When people simulate a perceived
  facial expression, they partially activate the corresponding emotional state
  in themselves, which provides a basis for inferring the underlying emotion of
  the expresser. We integrate recent evidence in favor of a role for
  sensorimotor simulation in emotion recognition. We then connect this account
  to a domain-general understanding of how sensory information from multiple
  modalities is integrated to generate perceptual predictions in the brain.
  People's recognition and understanding of others' facial expressions is
  compromised by experimental (e.g., mechanical blocking) and clinical (e.g.,
  facial paralysis and long-term pacifier use) disruptions to sensorimotor
  processing in the face.Emotion perception involves automatic activation of
  pre- and primary-motor and somatosensory cortices, and the inhibition of
  activity in sensorimotor networks reduces performance on subtle or challenging
  emotion recognition tasks.Sensorimotor simulation flexibly supports not only
  conceptual processing of facial expression but also, through cross-modal
  influences on visual processing, the building of a complete percept of the
  expression.While automatic and presumably nonconscious, sensorimotor
  simulation of facial expressions is modulated by the perceiver's social

  the neural bases underlying the variability of WM precision, and how WM
  precision is preserved under high load. To fill this gap, we combined human
  fMRI with computational modeling of behavioral performance in a delayed

  precision and an increase of precision variability under high loads (5 > 3 > 1
  colors). Load-dependent BOLD signals in primary visual cortex (V1) and
  superior intraparietal sulcus (IPS), measured during the WM task at 2–4 s

  changes in the variability of WM precision. Although stronger load-related
  BOLD increase in superior IPS was related to lower increases in precision
  variability, thus stabilizing WM performance, the reverse was observed for V1.
  Finally, the detrimental effect of load on behavioral precision and precision
  variability was accompanied by a load-related decline in the accuracy of

  memory (WM), including expectation, encoding, and maintenance. During WM
  maintenance period, an “incidental cue” can bring one of the two items into a
  privileged state and make the privileged item be recalled with higher
  precision, despite being irrelevant to which one to be probed as the target.
  With regard to the different representational states of WM, it’s unclear
  whether there is top-down modulation on earth sensory cortical areas. Here, We
  used this behavioral paradigm of “incidental cue” and event-related fMRI to
  investigate whether there were a privileged WM state and top-down modulation
  for complex stimuli including faces and natural scenes. We found that faces,
  not scenes, could enter into the privileged state with improved accuracy and
  response time of WM task. Meanwhile, cue-driven baseline activity shifts in
  fusiform face area (FFA) were identified by univariate analysis in the
  recognition of privileged faces, compared to that of non-privileged ones. In
  addition, the functional connectivity between FFA and right inferior frontal
  junction (IFJ), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior frontal gyrus, right
  intraparietal sulcus (IPS), right precuneus and supplementary motor area was
  significantly enhanced, corresponding to the improved WM performance.
  Moreover, FFA connectivity with IFJ and IPS could predict WM improvements.
  These findings indicated that privileged WM state and potential top-down
  modulation existed for faces, but not scenes, during WM maintenance period.},

  utility of Bayesian methods, however, ultimately depends on the relevance of
  the Bayesian model, in particular whether or not it accurately captures the
  structure of the data and the data analyst's domain expertise. Even with
  powerful software, the analyst is responsible for verifying the utility of
  their model. To demonstrate this point, we introduce a principled Bayesian
  workflow (Betancourt, 2018) to cognitive science. Using a concrete working
  example, we describe basic questions one should ask about the model: prior
  predictive checks, computational faithfulness, model sensitivity, and
  posterior predictive checks. The running example for demonstrating the
  workflow is data on reading times with a linguistic manipulation of object
  versus subject relative clause sentences. This principled Bayesian workflow
  also demonstrates how to use domain knowledge to inform prior distributions.
  It provides guidelines and checks for valid data analysis, avoiding
  overfitting complex models to noise, and capturing relevant data structure in
  a probabilistic model. Given the increasing use of Bayesian methods, we aim to
  discuss how these methods can be properly employed to obtain robust answers to

  Successful replication attempts increase researchers' confidence in the
  presence of an effect, whereas failed replication attempts induce skepticism
  and doubt. However, it is often unclear to what extent a replication attempt
  results in success or failure. To quantify replication outcomes we propose a
  novel Bayesian replication test that compares the adequacy of 2 competing
  hypotheses. The 1st hypothesis is that of the skeptic and holds that the
  effect is spurious; this is the null hypothesis that postulates a zero effect
  size, H₀ : δ = 0. The 2nd hypothesis is that of the proponent and holds that
  the effect is consistent with the one found in the original study, an effect
  that can be quantified by a posterior distribution. Hence, the 2nd
  hypothesis-the replication hypothesis-is given by Hr : δ ∼ "posterior
  distribution from original study." The weighted-likelihood ratio between H₀
  and Hr quantifies the evidence that the data provide for replication success
  and failure. In addition to the new test, we present several other Bayesian
  tests that address different but related questions concerning a replication
  study. These tests pertain to the independent conclusions of the separate
  experiments, the difference in effect size between the original experiment and
  the replication attempt, and the overall conclusion based on the pooled
  results. Together, this suite of Bayesian tests allows a relatively complete
  formalization of the way in which the result of a replication attempt alters
  our knowledge of the phenomenon at hand. The use of all Bayesian replication
  tests is illustrated with 3 examples from the literature. For experiments
  analyzed using the t test, computation of the new replication test only
  requires the t values and the numbers of participants from the original study

  of signal detection theory, beginning with Fechner's (1860/1966) Elements of
  Psychophysics. Over and above the Gaussian-based mathematical framework
  conceived by Fechner in 1860, nearly a century would pass before
  psychophysicists finally realized in 1953 that the distribution of sensations
  generated by neural noise falls above, not below, the threshold of conscious
  awareness. An extensive body of single-unit recording and neuroimaging
  research conducted since then supports the idea that sensory noise yields
  genuinely felt conscious sensations even in the complete absence of
  stimulation. That hard-to-come-by insight in 1953 led immediately to the
  notion of a movable decision criterion and to the methodology of receiver
  operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Over the ensuing years, signal
  detection theory and ROC analysis have had an enormous impact on basic and
  applied science alike. Yet, in some quarters of our field, that fact appears
  to be virtually unknown. By tracing both its fascinating origins and its
  phenomenal impact, I hope to illustrate why no area of experimental psychology

  raised concerns about the prevalence of false positives in our discipline.
  However, false negatives can be just as concerning in areas of research that
  depend on finding support for the absence of an effect. This risk is
  particularly high in unconscious learning experiments, where researchers
  commonly seek to demonstrate that people can learn to perform a task in the
  absence of any explicit knowledge of the information that drives performance.
  The fact that some unconscious learning effects are typically studied with
  small samples and unreliable awareness measures makes false negatives
  especially likely. In the present article we focus on a popular unconscious
  learning paradigm, probabilistic cuing of visual attention, as a case study.
  First, we show that, at the meta-analytic level, previous experiments reveal
  positive signs of participant awareness, although individual studies are
  severely underpowered to detect this. Second, we report the results of 2
  empirical studies in which participants' awareness was tested with alternative
  and more sensitive dependent measures, both of which manifest positive
  evidence of awareness. We also show that, based on the predictions of a formal
  model of probabilistic cuing and given the reliabilities of the dependent
  measures collected in these experiments, any statistical test aimed at
  detecting a significant correlation between learning and awareness is doomed
  to return a nonsignificant result, even if at the latent level both constructs
  are actually related and participants' knowledge is completely explicit.

  an important step on the road to a thorough understanding of the cognitive and
  cerebral correlates of conscious perception. In this article, we present a
  critical review of research on subliminal perception during masking and other
  related experimental conditions. Although initially controversial, the
  possibility that a broad variety of processes can be activated by a
  non-reportable stimulus is now well established. Behavioural findings of
  subliminal priming indicate that a masked word or digit can have an influence
  on perceptual, lexical and semantic levels, while neuroimaging directly
  visualizes the brain activation that it evokes in several cortical areas. This
  activation is often attenuated under subliminal presentation conditions
  compared to consciously reportable conditions, but there are sufficiently many
  exceptions, in paradigms such as the attentional blink, to indicate that high
  activation, per se, is not a sufficient condition for conscious access to
  occur. We conclude by arguing that for a stimulus to reach consciousness, two
  factors are jointly needed: (i) the input stimulus must have enough strength
  (which can be prevented by masking) and (ii) it must receive top-down
  attention (which can be prevented by drawing attention to another stimulus or
  task). This view leads to a distinction between two types of non-conscious
  processes, which we call subliminal and preconscious. According to us,
  maintaining this distinction is essential in order to make sense of the
  growing neuroimaging data on the neural correlates of consciousness.},

  going unnoticed. But is this the case? It seems indeed that we are not always
  able to retrace the associative causal chains that lead to a thought or action
  (though the degree to which this is the case is still being debated) - but
  according to the way we consciously experience the world, it seems to be both
  immediate and complete to us. Apart from the fact that we may not be able to
  perceive the entirety of the external world due to information processing
  limitations inherent to our physical system, what seems more unsettling is
  that we may not even be able to experience all that we perceive! Is there some
  limitation of our own internal system that keeps not only the world, but the
  way this world is represented in us fundamentally unknowable to ourselves?},

  extensions of generalized linear models. Extensions to non-linear models are

  with the strength of serial biases in both monkeys and humans, as predicted by
  a computational model that integrates activity-based and activity-silent

  abstract = {Circular Statistics in R provides the most comprehensive guide to
  the analysis of circular data in over a decade. Circular data arise in many
  scientific contexts whether it be angular directions such as: observed compass
  directions of departure of radio-collared migratory birds from a release
  point; bond angles measured in different molecules; wind directions at
  different times of year at a wind farm; direction of stress-fractures in
  concrete bridge supports; longitudes of earthquake epicentres or seasonal and
  daily activity patterns, for example: data on the times of day at which
  animals are caught in a camera trap, or in 911 calls in New York, or in
  internet traffic; variation throughout the year in measles incidence, global
  energy requirements, TV viewing figures or injuries to athletes. The natural
  way of representing such data graphically is as points located around the
  circumference of a circle, hence their name. Importantly, circular variables
  are periodic in nature and the origin, or zero point, such as the beginning of
  a new year, is defined arbitrarily rather than necessarily emerging naturally
  from the system. This book will be of value both to those new to circular data
  analysis as well as those more familiar with the field. For beginners, the
  authors start by considering the fundamental graphical and numerical summaries
  used to represent circular data before introducing distributions that might be
  used to model them. They go on to discuss basic forms of inference such as
  point and interval estimation, as well as formal significance tests for
  hypotheses that will often be of scientific interest. When discussing model
  fitting, the authors advocate reduced reliance on the classical von Mises
  distribution; showcasing distributions that are capable of modelling features
  such as asymmetry and varying levels of kurtosis that are often exhibited by
  circular data. The use of likelihood-based and computer-intensive approaches
  to inference and modelling are stressed throughout the book. The R programming
  language is used to implement the methodology, particularly its "circular"
  package. Also provided are over 150 new functions for techniques not already
  covered within R. This concise but authoritative guide is accessible to the
  diverse range of scientists who have circular data to analyse and want to do
  so as easily and as effectively as possible.},

  make this interpretation easier such that these models can be employed more
  readily by social scientific researchers. We introduce three new measures: the
  slope at the inflection point (bc ), average slope (AS) and slope at mean
  (SAM) that help us assess the marginal effect of a predictor in a Bayesian
  projected normal regression model. The SAM or AS are preferably used in
  situations where the data for a specific predictor do not lie close to the
  inflection point of a circular regression curve. In this case bc is an
  unstable and extrapolated effect. In addition, we outline how the projected
  normal regression model allows us to distinguish between an effect on the mean
  and spread of a circular outcome variable. We call these types of effects
  location and accuracy effects, respectively. The performance of the three new
  measures and of the methods to distinguish between location and accuracy
  effects is investigated in a simulation study. We conclude that the new
  measures and methods to distinguish between accuracy and location effects work
  well in situations with a clear location effect. In situations where the
  location effect is not clearly distinguishable from an accuracy effect not all
  measures work equally well and we recommend the use of the SAM.},

  any systematic review or meta-analysis of clinical trials. Identifying its
  presence, investigating its cause and correctly accounting for it in analyses
  all involve difficult decisions for the researcher. Our objectives were: to
  collate recommendations on the subject of dealing with heterogeneity in
  systematic reviews of clinical trials; to investigate current practice in
  addressing heterogeneity in Cochrane reviews; and to compare current practice
  with recommendations. METHODS: We review guidelines for those undertaking
  systematic reviews and examine how heterogeneity is addressed in practice in a
  sample of systematic reviews, and their protocols, from the Cochrane Database
  of Systematic Reviews. RESULTS: Advice to reviewers is on the whole consistent
  and sensible. However, examination of a sample of Cochrane protocols and
  reviews demonstrates that the advice is difficult to follow given the small
  numbers of studies identified in many systematic reviews, the difficulty of
  pre-specifying important effect modifiers for subgroup analysis or
  meta-regression and the unresolved debate concerning fixed versus random
  effects meta-analyses. There was disagreement between protocols and reviews,
  often either regarding choice of important potential effect modifiers or due
  to the review identifying too few studies to perform planned analyses.
  CONCLUSION: Guidelines that address practical issues are required to reduce
  the risk of spurious findings from investigations of heterogeneity. This may
  involve discouraging statistical investigations such as subgroup analyses and
  meta-regression, rather than simply adopting a cautious approach to their
  interpretation, unless a large number of studies is available. The notion of a
  priori specification of potential effect modifiers for a retrospective review
  of studies is ill-defined, and the appropriateness of using a statistical test
  for heterogeneity to decide between analysis strategies is suspect.},

  commonly used/discussed and recently proposed publication bias correction
  methods. The simulation results suggested BALM yielded small biases, small
  RMSE values, and close-to-nominal-level coverage rates in inferring the
  population effect size and the between-study variance, and outperformed the
  other examined publication bias correction methods across a wide range of
  simulation scenarios when the publication bias mechanism is correctly
  specified. The performance of BALM was relatively sensitive to the assumed
  publication bias mechanism. Even with a misspecified publication bias
  mechanism, BALM still outperformed the naive methods without correcting for
  publication in inferring the overall population effect size. BALM was applied
  to 2 meta-analysis case studies to illustrate the use of BALM in real life
  situations. R functions are provided to facilitate the implementation of BALM.
  Guidelines on how to specify the publication bias mechanisms in BALM and how
  to report overall effect size estimates are provided. (PsycINFO Database

  The two most popular measures: mean squared error (MSE) and structural
  similarity (SSIM) index used in image processing have been analysed
  theoretically and experimentally by showing their origin,
  similarities/differences and main properties. Both measures depend on the same
  parameters: sample means, standard deviations and correlation coefficient. It
  has been shown that SSIM originates from the two generalised Dice measures and
  thus inherit their main property scale invariance. Consequently, this property
  leads to the dependence of the measure on absolute mean and standard deviation
  values. Similarly, MSE depends on the absolute standard deviation values. A
  new composite similarity/distance measure based on means, standard deviations
  and correlation coefficient (CMSC) which has been proposed recently exhibits

  pairwise dissimilarities from multiple 2D arrangements of items. Perceptual
  dissimilarities are classically measured using pairwise dissimilarity
  judgments. However, alternative methods including free sorting and 2D
  arrangements have previously been proposed. The present proposal is novel (a)
  in that the dissimilarity matrix is estimated by "inverse MDS" based on
  multiple arrangements of item subsets, and (b) in that the subsets are
  designed by an adaptive algorithm that aims to provide optimal evidence for
  the dissimilarity estimates. The subject arranges the items (represented as
  icons on a computer screen) by means of mouse drag-and-drop operations. The
  multi-arrangement method can be construed as a generalization of simpler
  methods: It reduces to pairwise dissimilarity judgments if each arrangement
  contains only two items, and to free sorting if the items are categorically
  arranged into discrete piles. Multi-arrangement combines the advantages of
  these methods. It is efficient (because the subject communicates many
  dissimilarity judgments with each mouse drag), psychologically attractive
  (because dissimilarities are judged in context), and can characterize
  continuous high-dimensional dissimilarity structures. We present two
  procedures for estimating the dissimilarity matrix: a simple
  weighted-aligned-average of the partial dissimilarity matrices and a
  computationally intensive algorithm, which estimates the dissimilarity matrix
  by iteratively minimizing the error of MDS-predictions of the subject's
  arrangements. The Matlab code for interactive arrangement and dissimilarity

  cortex and its role in this cognitive process. First, we present evidence from
  brain-imaging studies that prefrontal cortex shows sustained activity during
  the delay period of visual working memory tasks, indicating that this cortex
  maintains on-line representations of stimuli after they are removed from view.
  We then present evidence for domain specificity within frontal cortex based on

  regions. We also propose that a second dimension for domain specificity within
  prefrontal cortex might exist for object working memory on the basis of the
  type of representation, with analytic representations maintained
  preferentially in the left hemisphere and image-based representations
  maintained preferentially in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, we discuss the
  possibility that there are prefrontal areas brought into play during the
  monitoring and manipulation of information in working memory in addition to
  those engaged during the maintenance of this information. Finally, we consider

  psychology as a science, but statistical power of studies has not increased,
  while the number of studies in a single article has increased. It has been
  overlooked that multiple studies with modest power have a high probability of
  producing nonsignificant results because power decreases as a function of the
  number of statistical tests that are being conducted (Maxwell, 2004). The
  discrepancy between the expected number of significant results and the actual
  number of significant results in multiple-study articles undermines the
  credibility of the reported results, and it is likely that questionable
  research practices have contributed to the reporting of too many significant
  results (Sterling, 1959). The problem of low power in multiple-study articles
  is illustrated using Bem's (2011) article on extrasensory perception and
  Gailliot et al.'s (2007) article on glucose and self-regulation. I conclude
  with several recommendations that can increase the credibility of scientific
  evidence in psychological journals. One major recommendation is to pay more
  attention to the power of studies to produce positive results without the help
  of questionable research practices and to request that authors justify sample
  sizes with a priori predictions of effect sizes. It is also important to

  locations of objects in a Euclidean space (the object configuration) from data
  consisting of the dissimilarities between pairs of objects. An important issue
  in MDS is finding an appropriate dimensionality underlying these
  dissimilarities. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient Bayesian
  approach for selecting dimensionality in MDS. For each column (attribute)
  vector of an MDS configuration, we assume a prior that is a mixture of the
  point mass at 0 and a continuous distribution for the rest of the parameter
  space. Then the marginal posterior distribution of each column vector is also
  a mixture of the same form, in which the mixing weight of the continuous
  distribution is a measure of significance for the column vector. We propose an
  efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating the mixture
  posterior distribution. The proposed method is fully Bayesian. It takes
  parameter estimation error into account when computing penalties for complex
  models and provides an uncertainty measure for the choice of dimensionality.
  Also, the MCMC algorithm is computationally very efficient since it visits
  various dimensional models in one MCMC procedure. A simulation study compares
  the proposed method with the Bayesian method of Oh and Raftery (2001). Three
  real data sets are analysed by using the proposed method.},

  event-related potential waveform was used as a marker of attentional
  suppression. While observers maintained a color in working memory,
  task-irrelevant probe arrays were presented that contained an item matching

  other areas are often analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). However,
  for effects with more than one numerator degrees of freedom, e.g., for
  experimental factors with more than two levels, the ANOVA omnibus F-test is
  not informative about the source of a main effect or interaction. Because
  researchers typically have specific hypotheses about which condition means
  differ from each other, a priori contrasts (i.e., comparisons planned before
  the sample means are known) between specific conditions or combinations of
  conditions are the appropriate way to represent such hypotheses in the
  statistical model. Many researchers have pointed out that contrasts should be
  “tested instead of, rather than as a supplement to, the ordinary ‘omnibus’ F
  test” (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this tutorial, we explain the mathematics
  underlying different kinds of contrasts (i.e., treatment, sum, repeated,
  polynomial, custom, nested, interaction contrasts), discuss their properties,
  and demonstrate how they are applied in the R System for Statistical Computing
  (R Core Team, 2018). In this context, we explain the generalized inverse which
  is needed to compute the coefficients for contrasts that test hypotheses that
  are not covered by the default set of contrasts. A detailed understanding of
  contrast coding is crucial for successful and correct specification in linear

  Presentation®, Psychophysics Toolbox, OpenSesame, Expyriment, Gorilla,
  jsPsych, Lab.js and Testable. Where possible, the packages were tested on
  Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, and in a range of browsers for the online studies,
  to try to identify common patterns in performance. Among the lab-based
  experiments, Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, Presentation and E-Prime provided the
  best timing, all with mean precision under 1 millisecond across the visual,
  audio and response measures. OpenSesame had slightly less precision across the
  board, but most notably in audio stimuli and Expyriment had rather poor
  precision. Across operating systems, the pattern was that precision was
  generally very slightly better under Ubuntu than Windows, and that macOS was
  the worst, at least for visual stimuli, for all packages. Online studies did
  not deliver the same level of precision as lab-based systems, with slightly
  more variability in all measurements. That said, PsychoPy and Gorilla, broadly
  the best performers, were achieving very close to millisecond precision on
  several browser/operating system combinations. For response times (measured
  using a high-performance button box), most of the packages achieved precision
  at least under 10 ms in all browsers, with PsychoPy achieving a precision
  under 3.5 ms in all. There was considerable variability between OS/browser
  combinations, especially in audio-visual synchrony which is the least precise
  aspect of the browser-based experiments. Nonetheless, the data indicate that
  online methods can be suitable for a wide range of studies, with due thought
  about the sources of variability that result. The results, from over 110,000

  account for between-studies heterogeneity. The number of studies on any topic
  is typically low, because research is cost- and time-intensive. At the same
  time, a host of potential moderators are introduced when similar research
  questions are examined in different labs, sampling from different populations,
  using idiosyncratic methods and instrumentation. Such between-studies
  heterogeneity presents a substantial challenge to data aggregation in classic
  meta-analysis. When the causes for heterogeneity are known a-priori, they can
  be accounted for using meta-regression. What is currently lacking, however, is
  an exploratory approach, to be used when heterogeneity is suspected, but it is
  not known which moderators most strongly influence the observed effect size.
  Recently, weighted regression trees have been used to explore heterogeneity in
  meta-analysis. Although this provides a promising first step, single trees
  have many limitations, which can be overcome by using random forests: A
  powerful learning algorithm, which is flexible, yet relatively robust to
  overfitting. The present paper introduces MetaForest: An adaptation of random

  that, in datasets as small as 20 cases, MetaForest outperforms single trees,

  Simple data simulations suggest that under conditions of sample size, number,

  areas can dynamically transform active VWM representations e.g., to activity
  silent or long-term memory representations. These latent codes evade detection
  via traditional paradigms as well as decoding methods and hence limit the
  conclusions that can be drawn about the role of certain brain regions in WM
  storage. More precisely we claim that a lack or a temporary disappearance of

  these areas are not essentially required to store and maintain active, or

  date = {2016-05-13},
  abstract = {This book was written with the belief that ordinal statistical
  methods--sometimes discussed under the title of "nonparametric
  statistics"--deserve much more serious attention as research tools than they
  have traditionally had. There are three classes of reasons for this: *Many
  behavioral variables constitute only ordinal scales, not interval measurements
  that are required for traditional statistics. *Various research issues that
  are of primary interest in behavioral research are themselves questions about
  order: Which group scores higher? Is the order on this variable similar to the
  order on that? *Inferences from ordinal statistics are less subject to
  distributional peculiarities of the data than are those from traditional
  statistics. Taking an innovative approach, this book treats ordinal methods in
  an integrated way rather than as a compendium of unrelated methods, and
  emphasizes that the ordinal quantities are highly meaningful in their own
  right, not just as stand-ins for more traditional correlations or analyses of
  variance. In fact, since the ordinal statistics have desirable descriptive
  properties of their own, the book treats them parametrically, rather then
  nonparametrically. The author discusses how ordinal statistics can be applied
  in a much wider set of research situations than has usually been thought, and
  that they can often come closer to answering the researcher's primary
  questions than traditional ones can. And he includes some extensions of
  ordinal methods in order to accomplish that end.}

  deficits in theory of mind (ToM) and emotion recognition. However, there are
  inconsistent findings, and it has been debatable whether such deficits persist
  beyond childhood and how similar social cognitive deficits are in ADHD v. ASD.
  METHOD: We conducted a meta-analysis of social cognition, including emotion
  recognition and ToM, studies in ADHD compared with healthy controls and ASD.
  The current meta-analysis involved 44 studies comparing ADHD (n = 1999) with
  healthy controls (n = 1725) and 17 studies comparing ADHD (n = 772) with ASD
  (n = 710). RESULTS: Facial and vocal emotion recognition (d = 0.40-0.44) and
  ToM (d = 0.43) abilities were significantly impaired in ADHD. The most robust
  facial emotion recognition deficits were evident in anger and fear. Social
  cognitive deficits were either very subtle (emotion recognition) or
  non-significant (ToM) in adults with ADHD. Deficits in social cognition,
  especially ToM, were significantly more pronounced in ASD compared with ADHD.
  General cognitive impairment has contributed to social cognitive deficits in
  ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Performance of individuals with ADHD on social cognition
  lies intermediate between ASD and healthy controls. However, developmental
  trajectories of social cognition probably differ between ADHD and ASD as
  social cognitive deficits in ADHD might be improving with age in most
  individuals. There is a need for studies investigating a potential subtype of
  ADHD with persistent social cognitive deficits and exploring longitudinal
  changes in social cognition during development.},

  angry face benefit in VSTM. Participants were shown between one and four
  to-be-remembered angry, happy, or neutral faces, and after a short retention
  delay they stated whether a single probe face had been present or not in the
  previous display. All faces in any one display expressed the same emotion, and
  the task required memory for face identity. We find enhanced VSTM for angry
  face identities and describe the right hemisphere brain network underpinning
  this effect, which involves the globus pallidus, superior temporal sulcus, and
  frontal lobe. Increased activity in the globus pallidus was significantly
  correlated with the angry benefit in VSTM. Areas modulated by emotion were
  distinct from those modulated by memory load. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our
  results provide evidence for a key role of the basal ganglia as an interface

  orderly sequence of simple and well-specified steps to solve a complex

  response inhibition and planning. In a first between-group cluster-randomized
  controlled trial, we tested the effects of 1-month coding activities on 76
  first graders' planning and response inhibition against those of 1-month
  standard STEM activities of a control group. In a second study, we tested the
  effects of 1-month coding activities of 17 second graders in two ways: within
  group (longitudinally), against 7 months of standard activities experienced by
  the same children (experimental group); and between groups, in comparison to
  the effects of standard STEM activities in a control group of 19 second
  graders. The results of the two studies show significant benefits of learning
  to code: children exposed to coding improved significantly more in planning
  and inhibition tasks than control children did. The longitudinal data showed
  that improvements in planning and inhibition skills after 1 month of coding
  activities (eight lessons) were equivalent to or greater than the improvement
  attained after 7 months of standard activities. These findings support the

  1st-grade children's gains in coding skills that follow instructional
  intervention transfer to two important executive functions (EFs): planning and
  response inhibition. One-hundred seventy-nine (179) first graders from 5
  schools and 10 class groups, with no prior experience of coding, were randomly
  assigned to an experimental (coding, 5 classes) or control (standard STEM, 5
  classes) instructional condition. The experimental intervention involved 8 h
  of coding activities (two weekly lessons for 4 weeks), through the Code.org
  platform. Children in the control group were exposed to standard STEM
  instruction. Four coding tasks drawn from Code.org, two standardized planning
  tasks (Elithorn maze test and Tower of London, ToL, test) and two standardized
  response inhibition tasks (NEPSY-II inhibition subtest and numerical Stroop),
  were used to assess children's skills at the pretest and posttest (after the
  instructional intervention). To measure retention, the same skills were also
  assessed for 44 children from the experimental group 5 weeks from the posttest

  only improved measurably children's ability to solve coding problems, but also
  their EFs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve
  standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses. Such findings
  add to the still limited literature on the cognitive effects of coding,

  cognitive operations, even in tasks that have no obvious memory requirements.
  This conceptualization has been supported by dual-task experiments, in which
  interference is observed between a primary task involving short-term memory
  storage and a secondary task that presumably requires the same buffer as the
  primary task. Little or no interference is typically observed when the
  secondary task is very simple. Here, we test the hypothesis that even very
  simple tasks require the working memory buffer, but interference can be
  minimized by using activity-silent representations to store the information
  from the primary task. We tested this hypothesis using dual-task paradigm in
  which a simple discrimination task was interposed in the retention interval of
  a change detection task. We used contralateral delay activity (CDA) to track
  the active maintenance of information for the change detection task. We found
  that the CDA was abruptly disrupted following the interposed task. Despite
  this disruption of active maintenance, we found that performance in the change
  detection task was only slightly impaired, suggesting that activity-silent
  representations were used to retain the information for the change detection
  task. A second experiment replicated this result and also showed that
  automated discriminations could be performed without producing a large CDA
  disruption. Together, these results suggest that simple but non-automated
  discrimination tasks require the same processes that underlie active

  ability is referred to as short-term memory (STM). However, single-term labels
  such as this belie the complexity of the underlying construct. Here, we review
  evidence that STM is an amalgamation of three qualitatively distinct states.
  We argue that these distinct states emerge from the combination of frontal
  selection mechanisms (often considered the domain of attention and cognitive
  control), medial temporal binding mechanisms (often considered the domain of
  long-term memory, LTM), and synaptic plasticity. These various contributions
  lead to a single representation amenable to elaborated processing (focus of
  attention), a limited set of active representations among which attention can
  be flexibly switched (direct-access region), and passive representations whose
  residual traces facilitate re-activation (activated LTM). We suggest that
  selection and binding mechanisms are typically engaged simultaneously,
  providing multiple forms and routes of short-term maintenance. We propose that
  such a framework can resolve discrepancies among recent studies that have
  attempted to understand the relationship between attention and STM on the one
  hand, and between LTM and STM on the other. We anticipate that recent advances
  in neuroimaging and neurophysiology will elucidate the mechanisms underlying
  shifts and transformations among these representational states, providing a
  window into the dynamic processes of higher-order cognition.},

  whether IPS-phosphenes are generated without any contribution from the
  occipital cortex. In Experiment 1, healthy subjects showed that parietal
  phosphenes were reliable different in terms of threshold, highly variable in
  size and, in contrast to the occipital ones, they did not change in
  lateralization within the visual field. Moreover, to strengthen these results
  and to ascertain whether feedback to primary visual cortex is necessary for
  visual awareness to emerge, in Experiment 2, we induced phosphenes by applying
  TMS over the parietal cortex of the lesioned hemisphere in two hemianopic
  patients with a complete destruction of primary visual cortex. For both
  patients we found that they could perceive phosphenes, that a psychophysical
  threshold function could be created and that this function was not different
  from that obtained with healthy subjects. In addition, they could reliably
  draw the phosphenes and position them within their blind field and they could
  reliably score the phenomenical characteristics of their phosphenes both in
  terms of vividness and brightness in a manner similar to healthy subjects. The
  two brain-damaged patients have thus shown that stimulation of visual areas
  within the intraparietal sulcus of their lesioned hemisphere, can, in fact,
  elicit conscious visual percepts. These results seem to demonstrate that
  TMS-induced visual phenomenology over IPS can generate conscious visual
  percepts and, more importantly, that it does so independently of any

  the level of activity of whatever data the content-carrying specific
  mechanisms happen to represent. Each of these mechanisms are necessary because
  without the contents there is no conscious experience and without the required

  To control for the processing of the subliminal words, we included trials with

  discrimination task in Experiment 2, and additionally analyzed an ERP
  reflecting semantic congruence, the N400. We mainly replicated the results

  (peaking at ~170 ms post-stimulus), an effect that paralleled the abolition of
  awareness of face versus non-face image content. Furthermore, however, the
  masking appeared to render a strong attenuation of earlier feedforward visual
  sensory-processing signals. This early attenuation presumably resulted in
  insufficient information being fed into the higher level visual system
  pathways specific to object category processing, thus leading to unawareness

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In clinical trials, ordinal outcome measures are
  often dichotomized into two categories. In traumatic brain injury (TBI) the
  5-point Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) is collapsed into unfavourable versus
  favourable outcome. Simulation studies have shown that exploiting the ordinal
  nature of the GOS increases chances of detecting treatment effects. The
  objective of this study is to quantify the benefits of ordinal analysis in the
  real-life situation of a large TBI trial. METHODS: We used data from the CRASH
  trial that investigated the efficacy of corticosteroids in TBI patients (n =
  9,554). We applied two techniques for ordinal analysis: proportional odds
  analysis and the sliding dichotomy approach, where the GOS is dichotomized at
  different cut-offs according to baseline prognostic risk. These approaches
  were compared to dichotomous analysis. The information density in each
  analysis was indicated by a Wald statistic. All analyses were adjusted for
  baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Dichotomous analysis of the six-month GOS
  showed a non-significant treatment effect (OR = 1.09, 95\% CI 0.98 to 1.21, P
  = 0.096). Ordinal analysis with proportional odds regression or sliding
  dichotomy showed highly statistically significant treatment effects (OR 1.15,
  95\% CI 1.06 to 1.25, P = 0.0007 and 1.19, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.30, P = 0.0002),
  with 2.05-fold and 2.56-fold higher information density compared to the
  dichotomous approach respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the CRASH trial
  data confirmed that ordinal analysis of outcome substantially increases
  statistical power. We expect these results to hold for other fields of
  critical care medicine that use ordinal outcome measures and recommend that
  future trials adopt ordinal analyses. This will permit detection of smaller
  treatment effects.},

  because they directly model the cumulative distribution function from which
  summaries such as expectations and quantiles can easily be derived. Such
  models can also readily handle mixed type distributions. We describe the
  motivation, estimation, inference, model assumptions, and diagnostics. We
  demonstrate that CPMs applied to continuous outcomes are semiparametric
  transformation models. Extensive simulations are performed to investigate the
  finite sample performance of these models. We find that properly specified
  CPMs generally have good finite sample performance with moderate sample sizes,
  but that bias may occur when the sample size is small. Cumulative probability
  models are fairly robust to minor or moderate link function misspecification
  in our simulations. For certain purposes, the CPMs are more efficient than
  other models. We illustrate their application, with model diagnostics, in a
  study of the treatment of HIV. CD4 cell count and viral load 6 months after
  the initiation of antiretroviral therapy are modeled using CPMs; both
  variables typically require transformations, and viral load has a large

  curative, but rather alter patient outcome over the entire range of functional
  measures. Dichotomizing outcome scales reduces computational complexity, but
  discards substantial outcome information, artificially privileges only a
  single health state transition as clinically meaningful, and often reduces
  study power. Newer approaches to endpoint analysis have several advantageous
  properties. Summary of Review- The global statistic assesses treatment effects
  on multiple outcome measures simultaneously. However, translating the global
  statistic multidimensional vector effect at the population level into benefit
  or harm expected in the individual patient is problematic. Responder analysis
  adjusts outcome thresholds to patient stroke severity at study entry,
  identifying achievable goals for each patient. However, responder analysis
  still discards substantial outcome information. Shift analysis gauges change
  in outcome distributions over the full range of ascertained outcomes,
  incorporating benefit and harm at all health state transitions valued by
  patients and clinicians, and often increasing study power. Translation of
  findings of shift analyses into clinically accessible terms may be
  accomplished using the recently developed joint outcome table specification
  technique, which yields the following values for the number needed to treat
  for 1 patient to improve in a clinically important manner: nimodipine in
  subarachnoid hemorrhage, 6.8; coiling over clipping, 5.9; intra-arterial

  population, expected treatment response, and study purpose. Shift analysis

  with whole faces and with Bubbles (Gosselin \& Schyns, 2001), an extreme
  masking method thought by some to bias the observers toward the use of
  atypical processing mechanisms by limiting the use of whole-face strategies.
  We obtained a strong and negative correlation between individual face
  processing ability and the number of bubbles (r = -.79), and this correlation
  remained strong even after controlling for general visual/cognitive processing
  ability (rpartial = -.72). In other words, the better someone is at processing
  faces, the fewer facial parts they need to accurately carry out this task.
  Thus, contrary to what many researchers assume, face processing mechanisms

  abstract = {The measurement of many human traits, states, and disorders begins
  with a set of items on a questionnaire. The response format for these
  questions is often simply binary (e.g., yes/no) or ordered (e.g., high, medium
  or low). During data analysis, these items are frequently summed or used to
  estimate factor scores. In clinical applications, such assessments are often
  non-normally distributed in the general population because many respondents
  are unaffected, and therefore asymptomatic. As a result, in many cases these
  measures violate the statistical assumptions required for subsequent analyses.
  To reduce the influence of the non-normality and quasi-continuous assessment,
  variables are frequently recoded into binary (affected-unaffected) or ordinal
  (mild-moderate-severe) diagnoses. Ordinal data therefore present challenges at
  multiple levels of analysis. Categorizing continuous variables into ordered
  categories typically results in a loss of statistical power, which represents
  an incentive to the data analyst to assume that the data are normally
  distributed, even when they are not. Despite prior zeitgeists suggesting that,
  e.g., variables with more than 10 ordered categories may be regarded as
  continuous and analyzed as if they were, we show via simulation studies that
  this is not generally the case. In particular, using Pearson product-moment
  correlations instead of maximum likelihood estimates of polychoric
  correlations biases the estimated correlations towards zero. This bias is
  especially severe when a plurality of the observations fall into a single
  observed category, such as a score of zero. By contrast, estimating the
  ordinal correlation by maximum likelihood yields no estimation bias, although
  standard errors are (appropriately) larger. We also illustrate how odds ratios
  depend critically on the proportion or prevalence of affected individuals in
  the population, and therefore are sub-optimal for studies where comparisons of
  association metrics are needed. Finally, we extend these analyses to the
  classical twin model and demonstrate that treating binary data as continuous
  will underestimate genetic and common environmental variance components, and
  overestimate unique environment (residual) variance. These biases increase as
  prevalence declines. While modeling ordinal data appropriately may be more
  computationally intensive and time consuming, failing to do so will likely
  yield biased correlations and biased parameter estimates from modeling them.},

  While primes' impact on target perception has been clearly demonstrated,
  semantic response priming recently has been thrown into doubt (e.g. Klinger,
  Burton, \& Pitts, 2000). Finally, LRP studies have revealed that subliminal
  primes evoke motor processes. Yet, the premises for such prime-evoked motor
  activation are not settled. A transfer of priming to stimuli that have never
  been presented as targets appears particularly interesting because it suggests
  a level of processing that goes beyond a reactivation of previously acquired
  S-R links. Yet, such transfer has not always withstood empirical testing. To
  account for these contradictory results, we proposed a two-process model
  (Kunde, Kiesel, \& Hoffmann, 2003): First, participants build up expectations
  regarding imperative stimuli for the required responses according to
  experience and/or instructions. Second, stimuli that match these "action
  triggers" directly activate the corresponding motor responses irrespective of
  their conscious identification. In line with these assumptions, recent studies
  revealed that non-target primes induce priming when they fit the current task
  intentions and when they are expected in the experimental setting.},

  or more elaborate forms of information processing. Contemporary models equate
  consciousness with global processing, system complexity, or depth or stability
  of computation. This is in stark contrast with the powerful philosophical
  intuition that being conscious is more than just having the ability to
  compute. I argue that it is also incompatible with current empirical findings.
  I present a model that is free from the strong assumption that consciousness
  predicts superior performance. The model is based on Bayesian decision theory,
  of which signal detection theory is a special case. It reflects the fact that
  the capacity for perceptual decisions is fundamentally limited by the presence
  and amount of noise in the system. To optimize performance, one therefore
  needs to set decision criteria that are based on the behaviour, i.e. the
  probability distributions, of the internal signals. One important realization
  is that the knowledge of how our internal signals behave statistically has to
  be learned over time. Essentially, we are doing statistics on our own brain.
  This 'higher-order' learning, however, may err, and this impairs our ability
  to set and maintain optimal criteria for perceptual decisions, which I argue
  is central to perception consciousness. I outline three possibilities of how
  conscious perception might be affected by failures of 'higher-order'
  representation. These all imply that one can have a dissociation between
  consciousness and performance. This model readily explains blindsight and
  hallucinations in formal terms, and is beginning to receive direct empirical
  support. I end by discussing some philosophical implications of the model.},

  bias. Noise introduced at initial encoding and during maintenance degrades the
  precision of representation. Stimulus estimation is also biased away from
  recently encountered stimuli, a phenomenon known as adaptation. Within a
  Bayesian framework, greater biases are predicted to result from poor
  precision. We tested for this effect on individual difference measures.
  Through an online experiment, 202 subjects contributed data. During separate
  face and color blocks, they performed three different tasks: an immediate
  stimulus match, a delayed match-tosample, and a delayed match following 5 s of
  adaptation. The stimulus spaces were circular, and subjects entered their
  responses on a color/face wheel. Bias and precision of responses were
  extracted while accounting for the probability of random guesses. We found
  that the adaptation manipulation induced the expected bias in responses, and
  the magnitude of this bias varied reliably and substantially between subjects.
  Across subjects, there was a negative correlation between mean precision and
  bias. This relationship was replicated in a new experiment with 192 subjects.
  This result is consistent with a Bayesian observer model, in which the
  precision of perceptual representation influences the magnitude of perceptual
  bias.},

  random-effects null hypothesis, and (4) random-effects alternative hypothesis.
  These models are combined according to their plausibilities in light of the

  model-averaged meta-analysis therefore avoids the need to select either a

  moderate clinical impact on average we also need to know if the impact is
  moderate for all relevant populations, or if it varies from trivial in some to
  major in others. Or indeed, if the intervention is beneficial in some cases
  but harmful in others. Researchers typically report a series of statistics
  such as the Q-value, the p-value, and I2 , which are intended to address this
  issue. Often, they use these statistics to classify the heterogeneity as being
  low, moderate, or high and then use these classifications when considering the
  potential utility of the intervention. While this practice is ubiquitous, it
  is nevertheless incorrect. The statistics mentioned above do not actually tell
  us how much the effect size varies. Classifications of heterogeneity based on
  these statistics are uninformative at best, and often misleading. My goal in
  this paper is to explain what these statistics do tell us, and that none of
  them tells us how much the effect size varies. Then I will introduce the
  prediction interval, the statistic that does tell us how much the effect size

  measure the correspondence between the conceptual, perceptual, and neural
  representational structures of the six emotion categories Anger, Disgust,
  Fear, Happiness, Sadness, and Surprise. We found that subjects exhibited
  individual differences in their conceptual structure of emotions, which
  predicted their own unique perceptual structure. When viewing faces, the
  representational structure of multivoxel patterns in the right fusiform gyrus
  was significantly predicted by a subject's unique conceptual structure, even

  Finally, cross-cultural differences in emotion perception were also observed,

  to apply their preferred methods to remove bias, when there was no such
  intention. They also dismissed meaningful findings because of their dependence
  on criterion, but such dismissal is problematic: many real effects necessarily
  depend on criterion. Unfortunately, these issues are technically tedious, and
  we discuss how they may have confused others to misapply psychophysical
  metrics and to draw questionable conclusions about the nature of TMS

  was a clear posterior-to-anterior gradient in visual cortex, with stronger
  category information in ventrotemporal cortex than in early visual cortex. For
  objectively invisible stimuli, however, category information remained
  virtually unchanged from early visual cortex to object- and category-selective
  visual areas. These results demonstrate that although both objectively and
  subjectively invisible stimuli are represented in visual cortex, the extent of
  unconscious information processing is influenced by the measurement approach.
  Furthermore, our data show that subjective and objective approaches are
  associated with different neural correlates of consciousness and thus have
  implications for neural theories of consciousness.},

  up/down methods with fixed step sizes--in the spirit of Wetherill and Levitt
  (Br J Mathemat Statist Psychol 1965;18:1-10) or Kaernbach (Percept Psychophys
  1991;49:227-229)--instead of changing step size at each trial in accordance
  with best-placement rules--in the spirit of Watson and Pelli (Percept
  Psychophys 1983;47:87-91). It is generally assumed that a fixed-step-size
  (FSS) staircase converges on the stimulus level at which a correct response
  occurs with the probabilities derived by Wetherill and Levitt or Kaernbach,
  but this has never been proved rigorously. This work used simulation
  techniques to determine the asymptotic and small-sample convergence of FSS
  staircases as a function of such parameters as the up/down rule, the size of
  the steps up or down, the starting stimulus level, or the spread of the
  psychometric function. The results showed that the asymptotic convergence of
  FSS staircases depends much more on the sizes of the steps than it does on the
  up/down rule. Yet, if the size delta+ of a step up differs from the size
  delta- of a step down in a way that the ratio delta-/delta+ is constant at a
  specific value that changes with up/down rule, then convergence
  percent-correct is unaffected by the absolute sizes of the steps. For use with
  the popular one-, two-, three- and four-down/one-up rules, these ratios must
  respectively be set at 0.2845, 0.5488, 0.7393 and 0.8415, rendering staircases
  that converge on the 77.85\%-, 80.35\%-, 83.15\%- and 85.84\%-correct points.
  Wetherill and Levitt's transformed up/down rules--which require delta-/delta+
  = 1--and the general version of Kaernbach's weighted up/down rule--which
  allows any delta-/delta+ ratio--fail to reach their presumed targets. The
  small-sample study showed that, even with the optimal settings, short FSS
  staircases (up to 20 reversals in length) are subject to some bias, and their
  precision is less than reasonable, but their characteristics improve when the
  size delta+ of a step up is larger than half the spread of the psychometric
  function. Practical recommendations are given for the design of efficient and
  trustworthy FSS staircases.},

  Essentially, because the prime-classification task is more difficult than the
  experiment proper, the prime-classification task results may underrepresent
  the subjects' true ability to perceive the prime stimuli. To address this
  possibility, prime words were here presented in color. In the experiment
  proper, priming was observed. In the prime-classification task, subjects
  reported the color of the primes very accurately, indicating almost perfect
  control of task difficulty, but they could not identify the primes. Thus, I

  is sensitive to perception without awareness or to demonstrate a qualitative
  difference between the consequences of perception with and without awareness.
  Awareness has been controlled either by manipulating the stimulus conditions
  or by instructing observers on how to distribute their attention. The
  experimental findings based on all four approaches lead to the same
  conclusion; namely, stimuli are perceived even when observers are unaware of
  the stimuli. This conclusion is supported by results of studies in which
  awareness has been assessed with either objective measures of forced-choice
  discriminations or measures based on verbalizations of subjective conscious
  experiences. Given this solid empirical support for the concept of perception
  without awareness, a direction for future research studies is to assess the
  functions of information perceived without awareness in determining what is
  perceived with awareness. The available evidence suggests that information
  perceived without awareness both biases what stimuli are perceived with
  awareness and influences how stimuli perceived with awareness are consciously
  experienced.},

  evidence of above-chance performance on some implicit behavioral measure at
  the same time as chance-level performance (that is, a null result) on an
  explicit measure of awareness. A systematic review of 73 studies of contextual
  cuing, a popular implicit learning paradigm, involving 181 statistical
  analyses of awareness tests, reveals how underpowered studies can lead to
  failure to reject a false null hypothesis. Among the studies that reported
  sufficient information, the meta-analytic effect size across awareness tests
  was d(z) = 0.31 (95 \% CI 0.24-0.37), showing that participants' learning in

  abstract = {Effect sizes are the most important outcome of empirical studies.
  Most articles on effect sizes highlight their importance to communicate the
  practical significance of results. For scientists themselves, effect sizes are
  most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be
  used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects
  across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to
  calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect
  sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many
  articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address
  within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the
  similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I
  suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine
  inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate
  the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a
  supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for
  researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

  and cognitive neuroscience data have converged on the idea that information is
  encoded into working memory by allocating attention to internal
  representations, whether semantic long-term memory (e.g., letters, digits,
  words), sensory, or motoric. Thus, information-based multivariate analyses of
  human functional MRI data typically find evidence for the temporary
  representation of stimuli in regions that also process this information in
  nonworking memory contexts. The prefrontal cortex (PFC), on the other hand,
  exerts control over behavior by biasing the salience of mnemonic
  representations and adjudicating among competing, context-dependent rules. The
  "control of the controller" emerges from a complex interplay between PFC and
  striatal circuits and ascending dopaminergic neuromodulatory signals.},

  of information over a brief period of time, and working memory (WM) refers to
  the manipulation and use of that information to guide behavior. In recent
  years it has become apparent that STM and WM interact and overlap with other
  cognitive processes, including attention (the selection of a subset of
  information for further processing) and long-term memory (LTM-the encoding and
  retention of an effectively unlimited amount of information for a much longer
  period of time). Broadly speaking, there have been two classes of memory
  models: systems models, which posit distinct stores for STM and LTM (Atkinson
  and Shiffrin, 1968; Baddeley and Hitch, 1974); and state-based models, which
  posit a common store with different activation states corresponding to STM and
  LTM (Cowan, 1995; McElree, 1996; Oberauer, 2002). In this paper, we will focus
  on state-based accounts of STM. First, we will consider several theoretical
  models that postulate, based on considerable behavioral evidence, that
  information in STM can exist in multiple representational states. We will then
  consider how neural data from recent studies of STM can inform and constrain
  these theoretical models. In the process we will highlight the inferential
  advantage of multivariate, information-based analyses of neuroimaging data
  (fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG)) over conventional activation-based

  measure of bias, but not d', then it is safe to conclude that the manipulation
  in question did not affect perception but instead affected the placement of
  the internal decision criterion. However, the opposite may be true: an effect
  on perception may affect measured bias while having no effect on d'. To
  illustrate this point, we expound how signal detection measures are calculated

  the criterion measure rather than on d'. While d' can provide evidence for a
  perceptual effect, an effect solely on the criterion measure can also arise
  from a perceptual effect. We further support this conclusion using simulations
  to demonstrate that the Müller-Lyer illusion, which is a classic visual
  illusion that creates a powerful perceptual effect on the apparent length of a
  line, influences the criterion measure without influencing d'. For
  discrimination experiments, SDT is effective at discriminating between

  view, demonstrating that non-conscious information may affect behavior for
  several seconds, and suggesting that there exists a genuine non-conscious
  working memory system. I here combine behavioral and modeling approaches with
  time-resolved magnetoencephalography and multivariate pattern analysis to put
  this proposal to the test. In a first study, I rule out alternative
  explanations for the long-lasting blindsight effect, showing that it results
  from a genuinely non-conscious process. Crucially, this non-conscious
  maintenance is not accompanied by persistent delay-period activity, but
  instead stores information in “activity-silent” brain states via transient
  changes in synaptic weights. In a second set of experiments, I systematically
  evaluate key properties of conscious working memory in the context of
  long-lasting blindsight. While even multiple items and their temporal order
  may be stored non-consciously, manipulating stored representations is
  associated with consciousness and sustained neural activity. Together, these
  results challenge theories that equate the maintenance of information in
  working memory with conscious activity sustained throughout the delay period,
  but also contradict the notion of a genuine non-conscious “working” memory.
  Instead, I propose the existence of activity-silent short-term memory.},

  and further develop an idea proposed by Gelman and Carlin (2014) termed
  "prospective and retrospective design analysis". Rather than focusing only on
  the statistical significance of a result and on the classical control of type
  I and type II errors, a comprehensive design analysis involves reasoning about
  what can be considered a plausible effect size. Furthermore, it introduces two
  relevant inferential risks: the exaggeration ratio or Type M error (i.e., the
  predictable average overestimation of an effect that emerges as statistically
  significant), and the sign error or Type S error (i.e., the risk that a
  statistically significant effect is estimated in the wrong direction). Another
  important aspect of design analysis is that it can be usefully carried out
  both in the planning phase of a study and for the evaluation of studies that
  have already been conducted, thus increasing researchers' awareness during all
  phases of a research project. We use a familiar example in psychology where
  the researcher is interested in analyzing the differences between two
  independent groups. We examine the case in which the plausible effect size is
  formalized as a single value, and propose a method in which uncertainty
  concerning the magnitude of the effect is formalized via probability
  distributions. Through several examples, we show that even though a design
  analysis requires big effort, it has the potential to contribute to planning
  more robust and replicable studies. Finally, future developments in the

  indexed by object-substitution masking. The functional levels indexed by

  processing levels indexed by additional blinding methods is yet to be

  attentional blinding effects in addition to the level indexed by the

  abstract = {Consciousness has of late become a "hot topic" in neuroscience.
  Empirical work has centered on identifying potential neural correlates of
  consciousness (NCCs), with a converging view that the prefrontal parietal
  network (PPN) is closely associated with this process. Theoretical work has
  primarily sought to explain how informational properties of this cortical
  network could account for phenomenal properties of consciousness. However,
  both empirical and theoretical research has given less focus to the
  psychological features that may account for the NCCs. The PPN has also been
  heavily linked with cognitive processes, such as attention. We describe how
  this literature is under-appreciated in consciousness science, in part due to
  the increasingly entrenched assumption of a strong dissociation between
  attention and consciousness. We argue instead that there is more common ground
  between attention and consciousness than is usually emphasized: although
  objects can under certain circumstances be attended to in the absence of
  conscious access, attention as a content selection and boosting mechanism is
  an important and necessary aspect of consciousness. Like attention, working
  memory and executive control involve the interlinking of multiple mental
  objects and have also been closely associated with the PPN. We propose that
  this set of cognitive functions, in concert with attention, make up the core
  psychological components of consciousness. One related process, chunking,
  exploits logical or mnemonic redundancies in a dataset so that it can be
  recoded and a given task optimized. Chunking has been shown to activate PPN
  particularly robustly, even compared with other cognitively demanding tasks,
  such as working memory or mental arithmetic. It is therefore possible that
  chunking, as a tool to detect useful patterns within an integrated set of
  intensely processed (attended) information, has a central role to play in
  consciousness. Following on from this, we suggest that a key evolutionary
  purpose of consciousness may be to provide innovative solutions to complex or
  novel problems.},

  task to rule out conscious processes as a cause for these differences. Results

  across studies is a key feature of meta-analyses. This variability is
  reflected by measures like τ(2) or I(2), but their clinical interpretation is
  not straightforward. A prediction interval is less complicated: it presents
  the expected range of true effects in similar studies. We aimed to show the
  advantages of having the prediction interval routinely reported in
  meta-analyses. DESIGN: We show how the prediction interval can help understand
  the uncertainty about whether an intervention works or not. To evaluate the
  implications of using this interval to interpret the results, we selected the
  first meta-analysis per intervention review of the Cochrane Database of
  Systematic Reviews Issues 2009-2013 with a dichotomous (n=2009) or continuous
  (n=1254) outcome, and generated 95\% prediction intervals for them. RESULTS:
  In 72.4\% of 479 statistically significant (random-effects p0), the 95\%
  prediction interval suggested that the intervention effect could be null or
  even be in the opposite direction. In 20.3\% of those 479 meta-analyses, the
  prediction interval showed that the effect could be completely opposite to the
  point estimate of the meta-analysis. We demonstrate also how the prediction
  interval can be used to calculate the probability that a new trial will show a
  negative effect and to improve the calculations of the power of a new trial.
  CONCLUSIONS: The prediction interval reflects the variation in treatment
  effects over different settings, including what effect is to be expected in
  future patients, such as the patients that a clinician is interested to treat.
  Prediction intervals should be routinely reported to allow more informative

  that prefrontal cortex can be activated unconsciously. The depth, direction,
  and scope of these activations depend on several top-down factors such as the
  task being probed (task-set, strategy) and on (temporal/spatial) attention.
  Regardless, such activations-when mediated by feedforward activation only-do
  not lead to a conscious sensation. Although unconscious, these prefrontal
  activations are functional, in the sense that they are associated with
  behavioral effects of cognitive control, such as response inhibition, task
  switching, conflict monitoring, and error detection. These findings challenge
  the pivotal role of the prefrontal cortex in consciousness. Instead, it
  appears that specific brain areas (or cognitive modules) may support specific
  cognitive functions but that consciousness is independent of this. Conscious
  sensations arise only when the brain areas involved engage in recurrent
  interactions enabling the long-lasting exchange of information between brain
  regions. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that also the state of

  ``What is it that consciousness does?{''} would not be in the form of
  ``Consciousness is necessary for F,{''} where F is a fundamental, high-level

  information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a
  unitary episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be the

  Our study presents the first attempt to use the effect of gender on
  predictability in German to study the pre-activation hypothesis, capitalizing
  on the fact that all German nouns have a gender and that their preceding
  determiners can show an unambiguous gender marking when the noun phrase has
  accusative case. Despite having a relatively large sample size (of 120
  subjects), both our preregistered and exploratory analyses failed to yield
  conclusive evidence for or against an effect of pre-activation. The sign of
  the effect is, however, in the expected direction: the more unexpected the
  gender of the determiner, the larger the negativity. The recent, inconclusive
  replication attempts by Nieuwland et al. (2018) and others also show effects
  with signs in the expected direction. We conducted a Bayesian random-effects

  capacity benefits from figural information induced by the Kanizsa illusion.

  memory and depended critically on the illusion, not on the stimulus

  science by combining information across multiple studies and attempting to
  provide effect size estimates corrected for publication bias. Research on the
  reproducibility of meta-analyses reveals that errors are common, and the
  percentage of effect size calculations that cannot be reproduced is much
  higher than is desirable. Furthermore, the flexibility in inclusion criteria
  when performing a meta-analysis, combined with the many conflicting
  conclusions drawn by meta-analyses of the same set of studies performed by
  different researchers, has led some people to doubt whether meta-analyses can
  provide objective conclusions. DISCUSSION: The present article highlights the
  need to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses to facilitate the
  identification of errors, allow researchers to examine the impact of
  subjective choices such as inclusion criteria, and update the meta-analysis
  after several years. Reproducibility can be improved by applying standardized
  reporting guidelines and sharing all meta-analytic data underlying the
  meta-analysis, including quotes from articles to specify how effect sizes were
  calculated. Pre-registration of the research protocol (which can be
  peer-reviewed using novel 'registered report' formats) can be used to
  distinguish a-priori analysis plans from data-driven choices, and reduce the
  amount of criticism after the results are known. The recommendations put
  forward in this article aim to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses.
  In addition, they have the benefit of "future-proofing" meta-analyses by
  allowing the shared data to be re-analyzed as new theoretical viewpoints
  emerge or as novel statistical techniques are developed. Adoption of these
  practices will lead to increased credibility of meta-analytic conclusions, and
  facilitate cumulative scientific knowledge.},

  effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic
  inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the
  opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same
  problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in
  factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that
  averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even
  ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation
  of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that
  there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal
  values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or
  similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although

  distribution, not as a random draw from a dichotomous distribution (null vs.
  alternative). Moreover, because continuously distributed effects selected
  using a P < 0.05 filter must be inflated, the fact that they are smaller when
  replicated (reflecting regression to the mean) is no reason to sound the

  that most published P < 0.05 scientific findings are "true" (i.e., in the
  correct direction), with observed effect sizes that are inflated to varying
  degrees. We propose that original science is a screening process, one that
  adopts NHST logic as a useful fiction for selecting true effects that are
  potentially large enough to be of interest to other scientists. Unlike
  original science, replication science seeks to precisely measure the
  underlying effect size associated with an experimental protocol via large-N
  direct replication, without regard for statistical significance. Registered
  reports are well suited to (often resource-intensive) direct replications,
  which should focus on influential findings and be published regardless of

  correlation than either CR or PDW, particularly for low stimulus intensities.
  In general, all scales indicated above-chance performance when participants

  interpreted their findings in light of at least one of four leading
  neuroscientific theories of consciousness (N = 412 experiments), asking how
  methodological choices of the researchers might affect the final conclusions.
  We found that supporting a specific theory can be predicted solely from
  methodological choices, irrespective of findings. Furthermore, most studies
  interpret their findings post hoc, rather than a priori testing critical
  predictions of the theories. Our results highlight challenges for the field

  object complexity, those in the superior IPS and the lateral occipital complex
  are variable, tracking the number of objects held in VSTM, and representing
  fewer than four objects as their complexity increases. These neural response
  patterns were observed during both VSTM encoding and maintenance. Thus,
  multiple systems act together to support VSTM: whereas the inferior IPS
  maintains spatial attention over a fixed number of objects at different
  spatial locations, the superior IPS and the lateral occipital complex encode
  and maintain a variable subset of the attended objects, depending on their

  experience to construct affective predictions, represented multimodally in the
  brain. We do not live in a stable world, however. Some environments are
  uncertain, whereas others are not. In two experiments we investigated how
  experiencing previous certain versus uncertain contingencies shaped subjective
  reactions to future affective stimuli, within and across sensory modalities.
  Two S1-S2 paradigms were used as learning and test phases. S1s were colored
  circles, S2s negative/neutral affective pictures or sounds. During the
  learning phase, participants (N = 192, 179) were assigned to the certain (CG)
  or uncertain group (UG) and presented with 100\% (CG) or 50\% (UG) S1-S2
  congruency between visual stimuli. During the test phase, participants were
  presented with a new 75\% S1-S2 paradigm and visual (Experiment 1) or auditory
  (Experiment 2) S2s. Participants were asked to rate the expected valence of
  upcoming S2s (expectancy ratings) or valence and arousal to S2s. In both
  experiments, the CG reported more extreme expectancy ratings than the UG,
  suggesting that experiencing previous reliable S1-S2 associations led CG
  participants to subsequently predict similar associations. No group
  differences emerged on valence and arousal ratings, which were more
  prominently influenced by the new 75\% contingencies of the test phase rather
  than by previous learned contingencies. Last, comparing the two experiments,
  no significant group by experiment interaction was found, supporting the
  hypothesis of cross-modality generalization at the subjective level. Overall,
  our results advance knowledge about the mechanisms by which previous learned
  contingencies shape subjective affective experience. (PsycInfo Database Record

  abstract = {With the advent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-Corona
  Virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the theme of emotion recognition from
  facial expressions has become highly relevant due to the widespread use of
  face masks as one of the main devices imposed to counter the spread of the
  virus. Unsurprisingly, several studies published in the last 2 years have
  shown that accuracy in the recognition of basic emotions expressed by faces
  wearing masks is reduced. However, less is known about the impact that wearing
  face masks has on the ability to recognize emotions from subtle expressions.
  Furthermore, even less is known regarding the role of interindividual
  differences (such as alexithymic and autistic traits) in emotion processing.
  This study investigated the perception of all the six basic emotions (anger,
  disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise), both as a function of the
  face mask and as a function of the facial expressions' intensity (full vs.
  subtle) in terms of participants' uncertainty in their responses,
  misattribution errors, and perceived intensity. The experiment was conducted
  online on a large sample of participants (N = 129). Participants completed the
  20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Autistic Spectrum Quotient and then
  performed an emotion-recognition task that involved face stimuli wearing a
  mask or not, and displaying full or subtle expressions. Each face stimulus was
  presented alongside the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW), and participants had to
  indicate what emotion they believed the other person was feeling and its
  intensity using the GEW. For each combination of our variables, we computed
  the indices of 'uncertainty' (i.e., the spread of responses around the correct
  emotion category), 'bias' (i.e., the systematic errors in recognition), and
  'perceived intensity' (i.e., the distance from the center of the GEW). We
  found that face masks increase uncertainty for all facial expressions of
  emotion, except for fear when intense, and that disgust was systematically
  confused with anger (i.e., response bias). Furthermore, when faces were
  covered by the mask, all the emotions were perceived as less intense, and this
  was particularly evident for subtle expressions. Finally, we did not find any
  evidence of a relationship between these indices and alexithymic/autistic
  traits.},

  measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical

  We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these

  of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated

  offer some possible solutions. METHODS: We reviewed every original work using
  ROC curves and published in Clinical Chemistry in 2001 or 2002. For each
  article we recorded phase of the research, prospective or retrospective
  design, sample size, presence/absence of confidence intervals (CIs), nature of
  the statistical analysis, and major analysis problems. RESULTS: Of 58
  articles, 31\% were phase I (exploratory), 50\% were phase II (challenge), and
  19\% were phase III (advanced) studies. The studies increased in sample size
  from phase I to III and showed a progression in the use of prospective
  designs. Most phase I studies were powered to assess diagnostic tests with ROC
  areas >/=0.70. Thirty-eight percent of studies failed to include CIs for
  diagnostic test accuracy or the CIs were constructed inappropriately.
  Thirty-three percent of studies provided insufficient analysis for comparing
  diagnostic tests. Other problems included dichotomization of the gold standard
  scale and inappropriate analysis of the equivalence of two diagnostic tests.
  CONCLUSION: We identify available software and make some suggestions for
  sample size determination, testing for equivalence in diagnostic accuracy, and
  alternatives to a dichotomous classification of a continuous-scale gold
  standard. More methodologic research is needed in areas specific to clinical

  is the use of simulated random numbers to estimate some functional of a

  with an expectation of some function of a random variable. This is often done
  by means of a PDF decomposition. The problem is then solved by estimating the
  expected value by use of a simulated sample from the distribution of the
  random variable. Monte Carlo methods use random numbers, so to implement a
  Monte Carlo method it is necessary to have a source of random numbers. On the
  computer, we generally settle for pseudorandom numbers, that is, numbers that
  appear to be random but are actually deterministic. Generation of pseudorandom
  numbers is the topic of Chapter 7. Often, our objective is not to simulate
  random sampling directly, but rather to estimate a specific quantity related
  to the distribution of a given sample. In this case, we may want to ensure
  that a chosen sample closely reflects the distribution of the population we
  are simulating. Because of random variation, a truly random sample or a
  pseudorandom sample that simulates a random sample would not necessarily have
  this property. Sometimes, therefore, we generate a quasirandom sample, which
  is a sample constrained to reflect closely the distribution of the population
  we are simulating, rather than to exhibit the variability that would result

  Researchers planning replication studies often use the original study sample

  ignores uncertainty and publication bias in estimated effect sizes, resulting
  in overly optimistic calculations. A psychologist who intends to obtain power
  of .80 in the replication study, and performs calculations accordingly, may
  have an actual power lower than .80. We performed simulations to reveal the
  magnitude of the difference between actual and intended power based on common

  aim to correct for effect size uncertainty and/or bias. Our results imply that
  even if original studies reflect actual phenomena and were conducted in the
  absence of questionable research practices, popular approaches to designing
  replication studies may result in a low success rate, especially if the
  original study is underpowered. Methods correcting for bias and/or uncertainty
  generally had higher actual power, but were not a panacea for an underpowered

  Simple data simulations suggest that under conditions of sample size, number,

  abstract = {Throughout the last decade, the so-called replication crisis has
  stimulated many researchers to conduct large-scale replication projects. With
  data from four of these projects, we computed probabilistic forecasts of the
  replication outcomes, which we then evaluated regarding discrimination,
  calibration and sharpness. A novel model, which can take into account both
  inflation and heterogeneity of effects, was used and predicted the effect
  estimate of the replication study with good performance in two of the four
  data sets. In the other two data sets, predictive performance was still
  substantially improved compared to the naive model which does not consider
  inflation and heterogeneity of effects. The results suggest that many of the
  estimates from the original studies were inflated, possibly caused by
  publication bias or questionable research practices, and also that some degree
  of heterogeneity between original and replication effects should be expected.
  Moreover, the results indicate that the use of statistical significance as the
  only criterion for replication success may be questionable, since from a
  predictive viewpoint, non-significant replication results are often compatible
  with significant results from the original study. The developed statistical
  methods as well as the data sets are available in the R package

  Although this interpretation may be desirable in some cases, we develop a

  statistically significant in 36.1\% in RPP and 68.8\% in EE-RP suggesting many
  null effects among the replicated studies. However, evidence in favor of the
  null hypothesis cannot be examined with null hypothesis significance testing.
  We developed a Bayesian meta-analysis method called snapshot hybrid that is
  easy to use and understand and quantifies the amount of evidence in favor of a
  zero, small, medium and large effect. The method computes posterior model
  probabilities for a zero, small, medium, and large effect and adjusts for
  publication bias by taking into account that the original study is
  statistically significant. We first analytically approximate the methods
  performance, and demonstrate the necessity to control for the original study's
  significance to enable the accumulation of evidence for a true zero effect.
  Then we applied the method to the data of RPP and EE-RP, showing that the
  underlying effect sizes of the included studies in EE-RP are generally larger
  than in RPP, but that the sample sizes of especially the included studies in
  RPP are often too small to draw definite conclusions about the true effect
  size. We also illustrate how snapshot hybrid can be used to determine the

  improvements. By contrast, at least one version of the meta-analytic measure
  does not suffer from these problems. It differs from the others in rejecting
  dichotomous conclusions, the assumption that one study replicates another or

  In the latest model of sensorimotor simulation, an iterative communication
  between somatosensory, motor/premotor cortices, and visual regions has been
  proposed, which should allow more efficient discriminations among subtle
  facial expressions. Accordingly, individuals with congenital facial motor
  disability, specifically with MBS, should exhibit atypical communication
  within this network. Here, we aimed to test this facet of the sensorimotor
  simulation models. We estimated the functional connectivity between the visual
  cortices for face processing and the sensorimotor cortices in healthy and MBS
  individuals. To this aim, we studied the strength of beta band functional
  connectivity between these two systems using high-density EEG, combined with a
  change detection task with facial expressions (and a control condition
  involving non-face stimuli). The results supported our hypothesis such that
  when discriminating subtle facial expressions, participants affected by
  congenital facial palsy (compared to healthy controls) showed reduced
  connectivity strength between sensorimotor regions and visual regions for face
  processing. This effect was absent for the condition with non-face stimuli.
  These findings support sensorimotor simulation models and the communication

  published original studies by using large, multisite replication projects, at
  least 134 of which have been completed or are on going. These designs are
  promising to assess whether the original study is statistically consistent
  with the replications and to reassess the strength of evidence for the
  scientific effect of interest. However, existing analyses generally focus on
  single replications; when applied to multisite designs, they provide an
  incomplete view of aggregate evidence and can lead to misleading conclusions
  about replication success. We propose new statistical metrics representing
  firstly the probability that the original study's point estimate would be at
  least as extreme as it actually was, if in fact the original study were
  statistically consistent with the replications, and secondly the estimated
  proportion of population effects agreeing in direction with the original
  study. Generalized versions of the second metric enable consideration of only
  meaningfully strong population effects that agree in direction, or
  alternatively that disagree in direction, with the original study. These
  metrics apply when there are at least 10 replications (unless the
  heterogeneity estimate τ\textasciicircum=0, in which case the metrics apply
  regardless of the number of replications). The first metric assumes normal
  population effects but appears robust to violations in simulations; the second
  is distribution free. We provide R packages (Replicate and MetaUtility).},

  that compare the observed number of hypothesis test rejections
  (θ\textasciicircum) at an unpenalized α-level to the distribution of
  rejections that would be expected if all tested null hypotheses held (the
  “global null”). Specifically, we propose reporting a “null interval” for the
  number of α-level rejections expected to occur in 95\% of samples under the
  global null, the difference between θ\textasciicircum and the upper limit of
  the null interval (the “excess hits”), and a one-sided joint test based on
  θ\textasciicircum of the global null. For estimation, we describe resampling
  algorithms that asymptotically recover the sampling distribution under the
  global null. These methods accommodate arbitrarily correlated test statistics
  and do not require high-dimensional analyses, though they also accommodate
  such analyses. In a simulation study, we assess properties of the proposed
  metrics under varying correlation structures as well as their power for
  outcome-wide inference relative to existing methods for controlling familywise
  error rate. We recommend reporting our proposed metrics along with appropriate
  measures of effect size for all tests. We provide an R package, NRejections.
  Ultimately, existing procedures for multiple hypothesis testing typically
  penalize inference in each test, which is useful to temper interpretation of
  individual findings; yet on their own, these procedures do not fully
  characterize global evidence strength across the multiple tests. Our new

  S1s were colored circles, S2s negative or neutral affective pictures.
  Participants (Experiment 1 N = 121, Experiment 2 N = 116) were assigned to the
  certain (CG) or uncertain group (UG), and they were presented with 100\% (CG)
  or 50\% (UG) S1-S2 congruency during an uninstructed (Experiment 1) or

  presented with a new 75\% S1-S2 paradigm, and ambiguous (Experiment 1) or
  unambiguous (Experiment 2) S1s. Participants were asked to rate the expected
  valence of upcoming S2s (expectancy ratings), or their experienced valence and
  arousal (valence and arousal ratings). In Experiment 1 ambiguous cues elicited
  less negative expectancy ratings, and less unpleasant valence ratings,
  independently of prior experience. In Experiment 2, both groups showed similar
  expectancies, predicting upcoming pictures’ valence according to the 75\%
  contingencies of the test phase. Overall, we found that in the presence of
  ambiguous cues subjective affective experience is dampened, and that implicit
  previous experience does not emerge at the subjective level by significantly

  have failed) and false success determinations. These are shown to be high
  (often over 50\%) and in many cases uncontrolled. We then demonstrate that

  only a single replication study are almost always severely underpowered. Among
  the 40 findings for which ensembles of multisite direct replications were
  conducted, we find that between 11 and 17 (28\% to 43\%) ensembles produced
  heterogeneous effects, depending on how replication is defined. This
  heterogeneity could not be completely explained by moderators documented by
  replication research programs. We also find that these ensembles were not
  always well-powered to detect potentially meaningful values of heterogeneity.
  Finally, we identify several discrepancies between the results of original
  studies and the distribution of effects found by multisite replications but
  note that these analyses also have low power. We conclude by arguing that
  efforts to assess replication would benefit from further methodological work

  papers and their corresponding replication attempts. In our computation, we
  take into account the likely scenario that publication bias had distorted the
  originally published results. Overall, 75\% of studies gave qualitatively
  similar results in terms of the amount of evidence provided. However, the
  evidence was often weak (i.e., Bayes factor < 10). The majority of the studies
  (64\%) did not provide strong evidence for either the null or the alternative
  hypothesis in either the original or the replication, and no replication
  attempts provided strong evidence in favor of the null. In all cases where the

  disincentives to conduct replications and a tendency to frame replication as a

  abstract = {When analyzing data, researchers make some choices that are either
  arbitrary, based on subjective beliefs about the data-generating process, or
  for which equally justifiable alternative choices could have been made. This
  wide range of data-analytic choices can be abused and has been one of the
  underlying causes of the replication crisis in several fields. Recently, the
  introduction of multiverse analysis provides researchers with a method to
  evaluate the stability of the results across reasonable choices that could be
  made when analyzing data. Multiverse analysis is confined to a descriptive
  role, lacking a proper and comprehensive inferential procedure. Recently,
  specification curve analysis adds an inferential procedure to multiverse
  analysis, but this approach is limited to simple cases related to the linear
  model, and only allows researchers to infer whether at least one specification
  rejects the null hypothesis, but not which specifications should be selected.
  In this paper, we present a Post-selection Inference approach to Multiverse
  Analysis (PIMA) which is a flexible and general inferential approach that
  considers for all possible models, i.e., the multiverse of reasonable
  analyses. The approach allows for a wide range of data specifications (i.e.,
  preprocessing) and any generalized linear model; it allows testing the null
  hypothesis that a given predictor is not associated with the outcome, by
  combining information from all reasonable models of multiverse analysis, and
  provides strong control of the family-wise error rate allowing researchers to
  claim that the null hypothesis can be rejected for any specification that
  shows a significant effect. The inferential proposal is based on a conditional
  resampling procedure. We formally prove that the Type I error rate is
  controlled, and compute the statistical power of the test through a simulation
  study. Finally, we apply the PIMA procedure to the analysis of a real dataset
  on the self-reported hesitancy for the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
  vaccine before and after the 2020 lockdown in Italy. We conclude with
  practical recommendations to be considered when implementing the proposed
  procedure.},

  estimate an effect across an entire set of possible specifications to expose
  the impact of hidden degrees of freedom and/or obtain robust, less biased
  estimates of the effect of interest. However, if specifications are not truly
  arbitrary, multiverse-style analyses can produce misleading results,
  potentially hiding meaningful effects within a mass of poorly justified
  alternatives. So far, a key question has received scant attention: How does
  one decide whether alternatives are arbitrary? We offer a framework and
  conceptual tools for doing so. We discuss three kinds of a priori
  nonequivalence among alternatives—measurement nonequivalence, effect
  nonequivalence, and power/precision nonequivalence. The criteria we review
  lead to three decision scenarios: Type E decisions (principled equivalence),
  Type N decisions (principled nonequivalence), and Type U decisions
  (uncertainty). In uncertain scenarios, multiverse-style analysis should be
  conducted in a deliberately exploratory fashion. The framework is discussed
  with reference to published examples and illustrated with the help of a
  simulated data set. Our framework will help researchers reap the benefits of
  multiverse-style methods while avoiding their pitfalls.},

  assumption that the variance is proportional to that specified by the

  Estimation of the amount of overdispersion is often based on Pearson's

  mark-recapture, the data will be sparse. The estimator based on X2 can then be
  highly variable, and that based on D can have a large negative bias. We derive

  equivalence, the three-sided testing approach shows that it is sometimes
  possible to make an inference on the sign of the parameter of interest, even

  controversies in this area, including choosing effect sizes, why and whether
  power analyses should be conducted on already-collected data, how to mitigate
  the negative effects of sample size criteria on specific kinds of research,
  and which power criterion to use. For novel research questions, we advocate
  that researchers base sample sizes on effects that are likely to be

  (in basic research settings), given the limitations of interest-based minimums

  social-personality psychology. PUBLIC ABSTRACT: Recently, social-personality
  psychology has been criticized for basing some of its conclusions on studies
  with low numbers of participants. As a result, power analysis, a mathematical
  way to ensure that a study has enough participants to reliably "detect" a
  given size of psychological effect, has become popular. This article describes
  power analysis and discusses some controversies about it, including how
  researchers should derive assumptions about effect size, and how the
  requirements of power analysis can be applied without harming research on
  hard-to-reach and marginalized communities. For novel research questions, we
  advocate that researchers base sample sizes on effects that are likely to be
  cost-effective for other people to implement (in applied settings) or to study
  (in basic research settings). We discuss two alternatives to power analysis,
  precision analysis and sequential analysis, and end with recommendations for

  separate different cognitive processes underlying responses in binary decision
  tasks (e.g., the speed of information accumulation vs. the degree of response
  conservatism). This becomes possible because of the high degree of information
  utilization involved. Not only mean response times or error rates are used for
  the parameter estimation, but also the response time distributions of both
  correct and error responses. In a series of simulation studies, the efficiency
  and robustness of parameter recovery were compared for models differing in
  complexity (i.e., in numbers of free parameters) and trial numbers (ranging
  from 24 to 5,000) using three different optimization criteria (maximum
  likelihood, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and chi-square) that are all implemented in
  the latest version of fast-dm (Voss, Voss, \& Lerche, 2015). The results
  revealed that maximum likelihood is superior for uncontaminated data, but in
  the presence of fast contaminants, Kolmogorov-Smirnov outperforms the other
  two methods. For most conditions, chi-square-based parameter estimations lead
  to less precise results than the other optimization criteria. The performance
  of the fast-dm methods was compared to the EZ approach (Wagenmakers, van der
  Maas, \& Grasman, 2007) and to a Bayesian implementation (Wiecki, Sofer, \&
  Frank, 2013). Recommendations for trial numbers are derived from the results
  for models of different complexities. Interestingly, under certain conditions
  even small numbers of trials (N < 100) are sufficient for robust parameter

  abstract = {Recent models of sensorimotor simulation postulate that simulation
  aids ‘refining’visual representations of others’ emotional facial expressions
  through an iterative communication with the visual system. In order to test
  this aspect of sensorimotor simulation models, in the present investigation we
  recruited a sample of patients with Moebius syndrome (MS), characterized by
  congenital facial paralysis, and a control group of healthy participants. MS
  patients constitute a particularly interesting test as their congenital
  impossibility of producing facial movements and expressing emotions through
  the face should translate into a deficit of facial expressions processing.
  Here, MS and healthy participants underwent a task aimed at measuring the
  precision with which representations of facial expressions of emotions are
  maintained in visual working memory (VWM) by implementing a delayed estimation
  task. In each trial, participants saw a face with a certain intensity of
  facial expression (ie, of happiness, disgust or anger) and, after a short time
  interval of about 1 sec, they had to select the to-be-memorized image inside a
  circular array in which facial expressions of increasing intensity were
  presented in an orderly manner. The results indicated that MS participants
  built lower quality representations of the intensity of emotional expressions
  when compared to healthy participants. These findings support the role of
  sensorimotor simulation in improving the quality of emotional representations
  of facial expressions during early stages of processing.},

  morphed between sad and neutral and happy expressions and had to decide
  whether the face was sad or happy. The second experiment assessed automatic
  emotion processing by measuring the potency of emotional faces to gain access
  to awareness using interocular suppression. A follow-up investigation using
  the same tests was performed three months later. In the emotion recognition
  task, patients with major depression showed a shift in the criterion for the
  differentiation between sad and happy faces: In comparison to healthy
  controls, patients with MDD required a greater intensity of the happy
  expression to recognize a face as happy. After three months, this negative
  perceptual bias was reduced in comparison to the control group. The reduction
  in negative perceptual bias correlated with the reduction of depressive
  symptoms. In contrast to previous work, we found no evidence for preferential

  used effect sizes to indicate the effects of treatments. It indicates the
  difference between a treatment and comparison group after treatment has ended,
  in terms of standard deviations. Some meta-analyses, including several highly
  cited and influential ones, use the pre-post SMD, indicating the difference
  between baseline and post-test within one (treatment group). METHODS: In this
  paper, we argue that these pre-post SMDs should be avoided in meta-analyses
  and we describe the arguments why pre-post SMDs can result in biased outcomes.
  RESULTS: One important reason why pre-post SMDs should be avoided is that the
  scores on baseline and post-test are not independent of each other. The value
  for the correlation should be used in the calculation of the SMD, while this
  value is typically not known. We used data from an 'individual patient data'
  meta-analysis of trials comparing cognitive behaviour therapy and
  anti-depressive medication, to show that this problem can lead to considerable
  errors in the estimation of the SMDs. Another even more important reason why
  pre-post SMDs should be avoided in meta-analyses is that they are influenced
  by natural processes and characteristics of the patients and settings, and
  these cannot be discerned from the effects of the intervention. Between-group
  SMDs are much better because they control for such variables and these
  variables only affect the between group SMD when they are related to the
  effects of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pre-post SMDs
  should be avoided in meta-analyses as using them probably results in biased
  outcomes.},

  suggests that acute stress may impact WM functioning and associated cortical

  effects emerged for reaction times, acute stress detrimentally impacted
  accuracy on trials requiring WM maintenance. Drift diffusion modeling revealed
  that acute stress reduced overall drift rates (information processing speed),
  with larger group differences on maintenance trials. No effects emerged for
  response caution. To contextualize our findings, we conducted a meta-analysis
  (42 studies, 2008 participants, 210 effects). WM tasks were categorized by key
  demands: maintenance only, maintenance + overcoming competition, and

  probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into
  the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate

  model selection methods in practical model selection problems, highlight their
  differences and give recommendations about the preferred approaches. We focus
  on the variable subset selection for regression and classification and perform
  several numerical experiments using both simulated and real world data. The
  results show that the optimization of a utility estimate such as the
  cross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding overfitted models due to
  relatively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce.
  This can also lead to substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the
  performance evaluation for the selected model. From a predictive viewpoint,
  best results are obtained by accounting for model uncertainty by forming the
  full encompassing model, such as the Bayesian model averaging solution over
  the candidate models. If the encompassing model is too complex, it can be
  robustly simplified by the projection method, in which the information of the
  full model is projected onto the submodels. This approach is substantially
  less prone to overfitting than selection based on CV-score. Overall, the
  projection method appears to outperform also the maximum a posteriori model
  and the selection of the most probable variables. The study also demonstrates
  that the model selection can greatly benefit from using cross-validation
  outside the searching process both for guiding the model size selection and
  assessing the predictive performance of the finally selected model.},

  fitting structural equation models (SEMs) (such as path models or factor
  models) to meta-analytic data. Currently, fitting MASEMs may be challenging
  for researchers that are not accustomed to working with R software and
  packages. Therefore, we developed webMASEM; a web application for MASEM. This
  app implements the one-stage MASEM approach, and allows users to apply MASEM
  in a user-friendly way. The aim of this article is to provide a tutorial on
  one-stage MASEM and a practical guide to webMASEM. We will pay specific
  attention to how the data should be structured and prepared for webMASEM,
  because mistakes in this step may lead to faulty results without receiving an
  error message. The use of webMASEM is illustrated with an analysis of a
  meta-analytic path model in which the path coefficients are moderated by a
  study-level variable, a meta-analytic factor model in which the factor
  loadings are moderated by a study-level variable, and a meta-analytic panel
  model in which the effects are moderated by a study-level variable. All used
  datafiles and R scripts are available online.},

  abstract = {Many researchers have identified distribution shift as a likely
  contributor to the reproducibility crisis in behavioral and biomedical
  sciences. The idea is that if treatment effects vary across individual
  characteristics and experimental contexts, then studies conducted in different
  populations will estimate different average effects. This paper uses
  ``generalizability" methods to quantify how much of the effect size
  discrepancy between an original study and its replication can be explained by
  distribution shift on observed unit-level characteristics. More specifically,
  we decompose this discrepancy into ``components" attributable to sampling
  variability (including publication bias), observable distribution shifts, and
  residual factors. We compute this decomposition for several
  directly-replicated behavioral science experiments and find little evidence
  that observable distribution shifts contribute appreciably to
  non-replicability. In some cases, this is because there is too much
  statistical noise. In other cases, there is strong evidence that controlling
  for additional moderators is necessary for reliable replication.},

  Large Language Models, into social robotics research and experimental social

  research. This paper explores the transition from the traditional
  \textit{Experiment-Subjects Dyad} (ESD) experimental design to what we call an
  \textit{Experiment-AI-Subjects Triad} (EAIST) experimental design, where AI is
  used to generate experimental trials. In the EAIST experimental design, AI can
  provide adaptive stimuli and generative systems which may undermine
  experimental control and threaten the reliability of Human-Robot Interaction
  studies. We review specific examples, such as emotionally expressive chatbots
  and GAN-generated facial expressions, and identify the two sources of
  variability they introduce. We then propose a framework to enhance
  replicability in AI-driven research, drawing on principles from the Open
  Science movement. Key strategies include modular testing, parameter fixation,
  structured prompt engineering, and robust experimental design. Our
  recommendations aim to maintain the ecological advantages of AI while

  sources and populations, but until recently, there have been limited
  methodologies to approach the joint unsupervised analysis of multiple

  Analysis (BMSFA), identifies latent factors common to all studies, as well as
  latent factors specific to individual studies. However, BMSFA does not allow
  for partially shared factors, i.e. latent factors shared by more than one but
  less than all studies. We extend BMSFA by introducing a new method, Tetris,
  for Bayesian combinatorial multi-study factor analysis, which identifies
  latent factors that can be shared by any combination of studies. We model the
  subsets of studies that share latent factors with an Indian Buffet Process. We
  test our method with an extensive range of simulations, and showcase its
  utility not only in dimension reduction but also in covariance estimation.
  Finally, we apply Tetris to high-dimensional gene expression datasets to
  identify patterns in breast cancer gene expression, both within and across
  known classes defined by germline mutations.},

  failures in psychology and related empirical disciplines, there are urgent
  calls for open science and structural reform in the publishing industry. In
  the meantime, however, researchers need to learn how to recognize tell-tale
  signs of methodological and conceptual shortcomings that make a published
  claim suspect. I review four key problems and propose simple ways to detect
  them. First, the study may be fake; if in doubt, inspect the authors' and
  journal's profiles and request to see the raw data to check for
  inconsistencies. Second, there may be too little data; low precision of effect
  sizes is a clear warning sign of this. Third, the data may not be analyzed
  correctly; excessive flexibility in data analysis can be deduced from signs of
  data dredging and convoluted post hoc theorizing in the text, while violations
  of model assumptions can be detected by examining plots of observed data and
  model predictions. Fourth, the conclusions may not be justified by the data;
  common issues are inappropriate acceptance of the null hypothesis, biased
  meta-analyses, over-generalization over unmodeled variance, hidden confounds,
  and unspecific theoretical predictions. The main takeaways are to verify that
  the methodology is robust and to distinguish between what the actual results
  are and what the authors claim these results mean when citing empirical work.
  Critical evaluation of published evidence is an essential skill to develop as
  it can prevent researchers from pursuing unproductive avenues and ensure
  better trustworthiness of science as a whole.},

  testing relatively many participants with relatively few trials each. To
  compare the experimental power that would be obtained under each of these
  options, I simulated virtual experiments using subsets of participants and
  trials from eight large real RT datasets examining 19 experimental effects.
  The simulations compared designs using the first N T trials from N P randomly
  selected participants, holding constant the total number of trials across all
  participants, N P × N T . The [ N P , N T ] combination maximizing the power
  to detect each effect depended on how the mean and variability of that effect
  changed with practice. For most effects, power was greater in designs having
  many participants with few trials each rather than the reverse, suggesting
  that researchers should usually try to recruit large numbers of participants
  for short experimental sessions. In some cases, power for a fixed total number
  of trials across all participants was maximized by having as few as two trials
  per participant in each condition. Where researchers can make plausible
  predictions about how their effects will change over the course of a session,
  they can use those predictions to increase their experimental power.},

  significance testing (NHST) results from over half of the articles from this
  period. In line with earlier research, we found that half of all published
  psychology papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was
  inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight
  papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the

  average prevalence of inconsistent p-values has been stable over the years or
  has declined. The prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values

  could indicate a systematic bias in favor of significant results. Possible

  encourage sharing data, to let co-authors check results in a so-called

  one's own manuscript or during the review process.},
